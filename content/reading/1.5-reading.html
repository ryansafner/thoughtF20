<p>We are entering the era of mercantilism, and will spend at least a week in this era before we get to the Classical economists. There are a lot of well-develoepd writings from a lot of well-known thinkers of this era. Since we will not be lingering long, there is a lot of reading in a short amount of time. Thus, it’s most important that you read the <em>secondary</em> textbook, and in the <em>Reader</em>, read the biographies of Mun, Petty, and Mandeville, and then <em>skim</em> each of their writings to get a feel for what they are interested in and how they discuss it.</p>
