<p>We begin our first look at some of the earliest writings about economics.

<br />
</span></span> but it is pretty clear they occasionally touch on economic subjects.</p>
<p>While I have not assigned any Plato to you<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Mainly because it is not in our <em>Reader</em>!<br />
<br />
</span></span>, you should familiarize yourself briefly with Plato’s more famous claims and view of “the ideal State.”</p>
<p>A note of caution in reading Plato: Plato was the student of the famous Socrates (who did not write anything down), and he writes in dialogues, often between his Socrates character and other famous Greek contemporaries.</p>
<p>Aristotle - who was Plato’s greatest student - writes often in opposition to Plato’s views. Thus, it is useful to know what Aristotle is referring to.</p>
