<p>Today we dive into Smith’s analytical system, and some may say, the first organized discussion of economic analysis. The reading for Smith comes primarily from Book I: <em>Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour</em> and Book II <em>Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock</em> and a little bit from Book V: <em>Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth</em>. Your reader focuses primarily on Book I and the division of labor (pp.156-165), which is great, but sadly lacks selections on capital from Book II or public finance from Book V.</p>
<p>It is a good idea whenever you can, to read as much of Books I<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">You can skip Smith’s difficult digression on silver in Chapter 11.<br />

<p>Lastly, note the following useful tidbit, although he does use both words occasionally, “stock” is Adam Smith’s word for “capital.”</p>
