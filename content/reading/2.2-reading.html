<p>Though he is admittedly long-winded and lapses between theoretical statements, historical examples, and analogies or current events from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Adam Smith is quite easy and entertaining to read. Any educated person should read Smith, and, if you are interested in economics, <strong>you should read as much Smith as you can get your hands on.</strong> <em>Everything</em> is there (in some form).</p>
<p>Today we will focus primarily on understanding the system of the Classical Economics (so a bit of foreshadowing), as well as Smith’s refutation of mercantilism and physiocracy. As such, in addition to Smith, I will be quoting from Hume and Bastiat regarding their views on mercantilism (see recommended readings below). The quotes from Hume we have already seen.</p>
<p>The reading for Smith comes primarily from <em>Book IV: Of the Systems of Political Oeconomy.</em> These sections are in your <em>Reader</em> (p.165-179). I will also be quoting form <em>Book III</em> when describing the emergence of commercial society out of feudal society. You can find all of <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> online for free here:</p>

</ul>
<p>Next class we will dive into more of Smith’s analytical insights and the analysis of markets, prices, and economic growth. See the associated readings from <em>WON</em> <a href="/reading/2.3-reading">for next class</a>.</p>
