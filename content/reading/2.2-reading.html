<p>Though he is admittedly long-winded and lapses between theoretical statements, historical examples, and analogies or current events from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, Adam Smith is quite easy and entertaining to read. Any educated person should read Smith, and, if you are interested in economics, <strong>you should read as much Smith as you can get your hands on.</strong> <em>Everything</em> is there (in some form).</p>
<p>Today we will focus primarily on understanding the system of the Classical Economics (so a bit of foreshadowing), as well as Smith’s refutation of mercantilism and physiocracy. As such, in addition to Smith, I will be quoting from Hume and Bastiat regarding their views on mercantilism (see recommended readings below). The quotes from Hume we have already seen.</p>
<p>The reading for Smith comes primarily from <em>Book IV: Of the Systems of Political Oeconomy.</em> These sections are in your <em>Reader</em> (p.165-179). I will also be quoting form <em>Book III</em> when describing the emergence of commercial society out of feudal society. You can find all of <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> online for free here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html"><i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Wealth of Nations (Online)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Next class we will dive into more of Smith’s analytical insights and the analysis of markets, prices, and economic growth. See the associated readings from <em>WON</em> <a href="/reading/2.3-reading">for next class</a>.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-readings">Recommended Readings:</h2>
<p>Weingast discusses Adam Smith’s Book III on the economic history of Europe in the context of his views on economic development. Those of you in my <a href="https://devf19.classes.ryansafner.com">Economic Development course</a> should remember this quite extensively:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2881042"><i class="fas fas file-pdf"></i> Weingast (2016) - “Adam Smith’s Theory of Violence and the Political-Economics of Development”</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Below are the readings from Bastiat that I quote. I also make everyone in ECON 306 read (or at least I discuss) Bastiat’s broken window parable in “What is Seen and Not Seen”</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bastiat.org/en/petition.html"><i class="fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> Bastiat (1845) “The Candlemakers Petition”</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss.html?chapter_num=16#book-reader"><i class="fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> Bastiat (1850) “The Balance of Trade”</a></li>
<li><i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> Bastiat, 1848 <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss.html?chapter_num=4#book-reader">“What is Seen and Not Seen”</a>, (Section 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>As I mentioned in class, you might find <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/LevyPeartdismal.html">How the Dismal Science Got its Name</a> insightful and surprising. It is a 6 part series of blog posts based on research by David Levy &amp; Sandra Peart.
