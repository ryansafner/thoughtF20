# Required Readings:

- <i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*: Book IV excerpts in *Reader* (pp.165-179)

## If You Hadn't Yet:
- <i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Ch.4 "Adam Smith" in Landreth & Colander
- <i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Ch.2 "Adam Smith" in Blaug

Though he is admittedly long-winded and lapses between theoretical statements, historical examples, and analogies or current events from the 18^th^ century, Adam Smith is quite easy and entertaining to read. Any educated person should read Smith, and, if you are interested in economics, **you should read as much Smith as you can get your hands on.** *Everything* is there (in some form).

Today we will focus primarily on understanding the system of the Classical Economics (so a bit of foreshadowing), as well as Smith's refutation of mercantilism and physiocracy. As such, in addition to Smith, I will be quoting from Hume and Bastiat regarding their views on mercantilism (see recommended readings below). The quotes from Hume we have already seen. 

The reading for Smith comes primarily from *Book IV: Of the Systems of Political Oeconomy.* These sections are in your *Reader* (p.165-179). I will also be quoting form *Book III* when describing the emergence of commercial society out of feudal society. You can find all of *The Wealth of Nations* online for free here: 

- [<i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Wealth of Nations (Online)](https://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html)

Next class we will dive into more of Smith's analytical insights and the analysis of markets, prices, and economic growth. See the associated readings from *WON* [for next class](/reading/2.3-reading).
