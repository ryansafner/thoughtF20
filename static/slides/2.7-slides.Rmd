- Son of James Mill

- One of the most important writers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, in general

- *Autobiography*
  - insane private education under father James Mill (groomed J.S. to be the new prophet of Bentham’s utilitarianism)
  - disillusioned with Bentham’s (version of) utilitarianism (maximize pleasure, minimize pain for society)
  - nervous breakdown at 21

- Broke with Bentham (and James Mill) on utilitarianism
  - Benthamites too dogmatic and certain of their optimal policies; Mill is more open-minded
  - Pleasure-pain calculus is too *hedonistic*, humans are different from animals!
  - much more left-leaning than his father & Bentham
  - writes his own defense of utilitarianism; intent on improving the role of the individual in society

- One of Ricardian economics’ biggest proponents after Ricardo’s death

- *An Outline of the Science of Political Economy* (1836)
  - political economy as “the Nature, the Production, and the Distribution of Wealth”

- Political economy was a deductive science:

.quitesmall[
> “[P]remises consist of a very few general propositions...and scarcely requiring proof, or even formal statement, which almost every man, as soon as he hears them, admits as familiar to his thoughts...and his inferences are nearly as general, and, if he has reasoned correctly, as certain, as his premises.”

- Four self-evident principles of political economy:
  1. Rationality (people attempt to acquire wealth and minimize sacrifice)
  2. Malthusian population principle
  3. Diminishing returns in agriculture
  4. Principle of increasing returns for industry

- Political economy should strictly be a *positive* science, not normative:

  - capitalists are analogously paid for their patience and the disutility of abstaining from consumption

  - Classicals only focus on the former, ignore the latter

- Historically, market societies are young; most of history income was governed by tradition and custom (e.g. feudalism)

  - and yet:

- Often believed that Mill was a mere systematizer of Classical thought, but he had some original contributions:
  - theory of non-competing groups and effects on relative wages
  - recognized land has an opportunity cost, rent-less margin in Ricardo is false - rent is a cost in production
  - first focus on economics of the firm, economies of scale
  - treats supply and demand as functions relating price and quantity

  - increases in real wages have little effect in short run (takes time for population to increase and children to mature into laborers)
  - in long-run, Malthusian population principle dictates population growth depresses real wages to subsistence

- Theory allegedly used to argue against formation of unions (who aim to raise wages)
  - But no evidence classical economists argued against unions, many favored them

- But with decline of pop. principle, how to explain long run wages?

- Mill, along with Ricardo and Smith, naturally are skeptical of landlords and their lack of contribution to society

- Because land rent is price-determined, not price-determining (assuming land is fixed and has no opportunity cost), rent to landowners is mere surplus, not affecting production
  - Land does not contribute to production, merely a payment to “allow” production to take place
  - It’s really just standing space that somebody owns

- This implies that it would make no difference at all if rent goes to the landowners or to the government
  - Would have no effect on production

- Modern (State and local) property taxes:
  - low rates (1 or 2%)
  - assess the full value of your house (land lot + structures)
  - determined by a government assessor

- Versus George's .hi-purple[land value tax]:
  - tax the *full* value (100%) of rent needed to occupy *land*
  - artificial capital (i.e. structures) *not taxed*
  - assessors need to evaluate value of the unimproved land (i.e. if structures were bulldozed)

- Occupants enjoy full value of improvements and structures built on land (privately owned)

- Act as a tenant of the land (government is landlord), pay full rent value in taxes

- People who can productively use land have high WTP the tax, those who would leave it idle would sell at low prices to avoid tax (no more absentee landlords)
