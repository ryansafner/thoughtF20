  - nervous breakdown at 21

- Broke with Bentham (and James Mill) on utilitarianism

  - Pleasure-pain calculus is too *hedonistic*, humans are different from animals!
  - much more left-leaning than his father & Bentham

- Mill, along with Ricardo and Smith, naturally are skeptical of landlords and their lack of contribution to society

- Because land rent is price-determined, not price-determining (assuming land is fixed and has no opportunity cost), rent to landowners is mere surplus, not affecting production
  - Land does not contribute to production, merely a payment to ‚Äúallow‚Äù production to take place
  - It‚Äôs really just standing space that somebody owns

- This implies that it would make no difference at all if rent goes to the landowners or to the government

- A "simpler, easier and quieter way" (than socialism) to fix problems is to ‚Äúappropriate land rent for public use, by taxation‚Äù

- .hi-purple[Land] (classical ‚Äúfree gifts of nature‚Äù) vs. .hi-purple[‚Äúartifical capital‚Äù] (human-made improvements)

- Solution: allow private ownership in artificial capital, but abolish private ownership in land
  - but not centrally-planned, competitively managed

- Modern (State and local) property taxes:
  - low rates (1 or 2%)
  - assess the full value of your house (land lot + structures)
  - determined by a government assessor

- Versus George's .hi-purple[land value tax]:
  - tax the *full* value (100%) of rent needed to occupy *land*
  - artificial capital (i.e. structures) *not taxed*
  - assessors need to evaluate value of the unimproved land (i.e. if structures were bulldozed)

- Occupants enjoy full value of improvements and structures built on land (privately owned)

- Act as a tenant of the land (government is landlord), pay full rent value in taxes

- People who can productively use land have high WTP the tax, those who would leave it idle would sell at low prices to avoid tax (no more absentee landlords)

- Georgists often believed this .hi-purple[‚Äúsingle tax‚Äù] could replace all other taxes
