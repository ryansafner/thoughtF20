.right-column[
.quitesmall[
- *Autobiography*
  - insane private education under father James Mill (groomed J.S. to be the new prophet of Bentham‚Äôs utilitarianism)
  - disillusioned with Bentham‚Äôs (version of) utilitarianism (maximize pleasure, minimize pain for society)

- Broke with Bentham (and James Mill) on utilitarianism
  - Benthamites too dogmatic and certain of their optimal policies; Mill is more open-minded
  - Pleasure-pain calculus is too *hedonistic*, humans are different from animals!
  - much more left-leaning than his father & Bentham
  - writes his own defense of utilitarianism; intent on improving the role of the individual in society

> ‚ÄúLassiez-faire, in short, should be the general practice: every departure from it, unless required by some greater good, is a certain evil‚Äù
]

- But clear roles for government intervention

.quitesmall[
> ‚Äúit is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government. The ends of government are as comprehensive as those of the social union. They consist of all the good, and all the immunity from evil, which the existence of government can be made directly or indirectly to bestow‚Äù

David Ricardo

1772-1823
]
]

.right-column[

- Ricardo (and followers, like Senior) are very theoretical:
  - abstract away from complexities of reality
  - make assumptions
  - logically deduce conclusions and policy implications from model

- Ignore real world evidence that suggests the contrary?
  - retool theoretical models

Nassau Senior

- One of Ricardian economics‚Äô biggest proponents after Ricardo‚Äôs death

- *An Outline of the Science of Political Economy* (1836)
  - political economy as ‚Äúthe Nature, the Production, and the Distribution of Wealth‚Äù

- Political economy was a deductive science:

,quitesmall[
> ‚Äú[P]remises consist of a very few general propositions...and scarcely requiring proof, or even formal statement, which almost every man, as soon as he hears them, admits as familiar to his thoughts...and his inferences are nearly as general, and, if he has reasoned correctly, as certain, as his premises.‚Äù

Nassau Senior

1790-1864
]
]

.right-column[

- Four self-evident principles of political economy:
  1. Rationality (people attempt to acquire wealth and minimize sacrifice)
  2. Malthusian population principle
  3. Diminishing returns in agriculture
  4. Principle of increasing returns for industry

- Political economy should strictly be a *positive* science, not normative:

.quitesmall[
> ‚Äúconclusions, whatever their generality and their truth, do not authorize [an economist] in adding a single syllable of advice.‚Äù

]
]

# Mounting Evidence Against Ricardian Economics

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Ricardian economists believed that technological improvements in agriculture would not offset diminishing returns

- By 1830s, clear that food production greatly *exceeding* population growth (due to technological improvement)!

- Ricardians (like Senior) did not change their models, kept holding out that it would not last

- Blaug: ‚ÄúThe divorce between theory and facts was probably never more complete than in the heydey of Ricardian economics‚Äù
  - Have modern economists internalized this lesson yet? üòÖ

# Socialist Critiques of Ricardian Economics

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Following Godwin and the utopians, a new socialist writers launching critiques of market economy and classical (Ricardian) economics
  - Henri Sant-Simon, Charles Fourier, Robert Owen

- Viewed society in market economy not as harmonious, but full of conflicts
  - private property a major cause of the evils of society
  - competition creates chaos, better to have a rational ordering of production
  - implications of LTV: if all value is from labor content, why are workers not paid the full value of the product?

- If we can attain a more just distribution, then 

> ‚Äúthe principle of individual property would have been found to have no necessary connection with the physical and social evils which almost all Socialist writers assume to be inseparable from it.‚Äù

- View that competition is beneficial to society:

> ‚ÄúCompetition is beneficial to society; ‚Äúevery restriction of it is an evil, and every extension of it, even if for the time injuriously affecting some classes of labourers, is always an ultimate good.‚Äù

.right-column[

- Following Smith and Ricardo, Mill criticizes landlords:

> ‚Äú[Landlords] grow richer, as it were in their sleep, without working, risking, or economizing. What claim have they, on the general principle of social justice, to this accession of riches?‚Äù

- Advocated a tax on land rent, just like Ricardo
