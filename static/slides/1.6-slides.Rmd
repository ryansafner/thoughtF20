> "The first thing to be considered is, ‘Whether the price of the hire of money can be regulated by law?’ And to that I think...it is manifest it cannot....it will be impossible, by any contrivance of law, to hinder men, skilled in the power they have over their own goods...to purchase money to be lent to them, at what rate soever their occasions shall make it necessary for them to have it...no man borrows money, or pays use, out of mere pleasure: it is the want of money that drives men to that trouble and charge of borrowing; and proportionably to this want, so will every one have it, whatever price it cost him," (p.63 in *Reader*)

> "What then will be the unavoidable consequences of such a law?

> 1. It will make the difficulty of borrowing and lending much greater, whereby trade...will be obstructed

> 2. It will be a predjuce to none, but those who need most assistance and help...whose estates lying in money...to have no more profit of their money, than what interest the law barely allows.

> 3. It will increase the advantage of bankers and scriveners, and other such expert brokers..." (p.63 in *Reader*)

- Likens it to rent on land, but for money

> "Money, therefore, in buying and selling, being perfectly in the same condition with other commodities, and subject to all the same laws of value, let us next see how it comes to be of the same nature with land, by yielding a certain yearly income, which we call use, or interest." (p.63 in *Reader*)

- Idea of a .hi-purple[natural rate of interest]
  - important in 20th century macroeconomic debates

.smallest[
> "Now, I think, the natural interest of money is raised two ways: first, when the money of a country is but little, in proportion to the debts of the inhabitants, one amongst another...Second, that, which constantly raises the natural interest of money, is, when money is little, in proportion to the trade of a country...It is in vain, therefore, to go about effectually to reduce the price of interest by a law; and you may as rationally hope to set a fixed rate upon the hire of houses, or ships, as of money." (p.65 in *Reader*)

- A clear quantity theory of money!

.smallest[
> "[T]he measure of the value of money, in proportion to any thing purchaseable by it, is the quantity of the ready money we have in comparison with the quantity of that thing, and its vent; or, which amounts to the same thing, the price of any commodity rises or falls, by the proportion of the number of buyers and sellers: this rule holds universally in all things that are to be bought and sold, (p.68 in *Reader*)
