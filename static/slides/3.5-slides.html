- It was Cournot who (in 1838!) devised the `\(MR=MC\)` rule for profit-maximization

`$$R'(p)=f(p)+pf'(p)$$`

- Marshall adopted Cournot’s approach but focused on equilibrium in terms of total revenues and total costs rather than marginal conditions
  - Marginal revenue would have to be “rediscovered” in 1920s with “imperfect competition”

`$$\pi=R(q)-C(q)$$`

&gt; “But here we may read a lesson from the young trees of the forest as they struggle upwards through the benumbing shade of their older rivals. Many succumb on the way, and a few only survive; those few become stronger with every year...and at last in their turn they tower above their neighbours...but sooner or later age tells on them all. Though the taller ones have a better access to light and air than their rivals, they gradually lose vitality; and one after another they give place to others, which, though of less material strength, have on their side the vigour of youth,” (p.506 in *Reader*).

&gt; “When therefore we are considering the broad results which the growth of wealth and population exert on the economies of production...our conclusions [are] not very much affected by the fact that many of these economies depend directly on the size of the individual establishments engaged in the production, and that in almost every trade there is a constant rise and fall of large businesses, at any one moment some firms being in the ascending phase and others in the descending” (p.506 in *Reader*).

&gt; “These results will be of great importance when we come to discuss the causes which govern the supply price of a commodity. We shall have to analyse carefully the normal cost of producing a commodity, relatively to a given aggregate volume of production; and for this purpose we shall have to study *the expenses of a representative producer* for that aggregate volume...our representative firm must be one which has had a fairly long life, and fair success, which is managed with normal ability, and which has normal access to the economies, external and internal, which belong to that aggregate volume of production...,” (p.507 in *Reader*).

&gt; “We cannot see this by looking at one or two firms taken at random: but we can see it fairly well by selecting, after a broad survey, a firm, whether in private or joint-stock management...that represents, to the best of our judgment, this particular average, (ibid).”

The study of some group of tendencies is isolated by the assumption *other things being equal*: the existence of other tendencies is not denied, but their disturbing effect is neglected for a time. The more the issue is thus narrowed, the more exactly can it be handled: but also the less closely does it correspond to real life.,” (p.516 in *Reader*).

&gt; “To go over the ground in another way. Market values are governed by the relation of demand to stocks actually in the market; with more or less reference to ‘future’ supplies...the current supply is in itself partly due to the action of producers in the past; and this action has been determined on as the result of a comparison of the prices which they expect to get for their goods with the expenses to which they will be put in producing them,” (pp.516-517 in *Reader*).

&gt; “For short periods people take the stock of appliances for production as practically fixed; and they are governed by their expectations of demand...in long periods they set themselves to adjust the flow of these appliances to their expectations of demand,” (pp.517 in *Reader*).

The supply of specialized skills and ability, of suitable machinery and other material capital, and of the appropriate industrial organization has not time to be fully adapted to demand; but the producers have to adjust their supply to the demand as best they can with the appliances already at their disposal...In long periods on the other hand all investments of capital and effort in providing the material plant and the organization of business, and in acquiring trade knowledge and specialized ability, have time to be adjusted to the incomes which are expected to be earned by them: and the estimates of those incomes therefore directly govern supply, and are the true long-period normal supply price of the commodities produced.”  (pp.519-5207 in *Reader*)

&gt; “The fact is that in every state of society there is some fraction of their income which people find it worth while to keep in the form of currency, it may be a fifth, or a tenth, or a twentieth. A large command of resources in the form of currency renders their business easy and smooth, and puts them at an advantage in bargaining; but, on the other hand, it locks up in a barren form resources that might yield an income of gratification if invested, say, in extra furniture; or a money income, if invested in extra machinery or cattle.”

&gt; “[I]f everything else remains the same, then there is this direct relationship between the volume of currency and the level of prices...Of course, the less the proportion of their resources which peopel care to keep in the form of currency, the lower will be the aggregate value of the currency, that is, the higher will prices be with a given volume of the currency.”
