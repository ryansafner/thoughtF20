  - income-compensated demand curve
  - differentiates income vs. substitution effects
  - general equilibrium

- Came up with the “Kaldor-Hicks” criterion for efficiency (in part, with Kaldor)

# Markets and Kaldor-Hicks Efficiency

.pull-left[

- .hi[Kaldor-Hicks Improvement]: an action improves efficiency its generates more social gains than losses
    - those made better off could in principle compensate those made worse off

- .hi[Kaldor-Hicks efficiency]: no potential Kaldor-Hicks improvements exist

- Keeps intuitive appeal of Pareto but more practical
    - Every Pareto improvement is a KH-improvement (but not the other way around!)
    
- Consider policies where winners' maximum WTP $>$ losers' minimum WTA

- Policies should **maximize social value of resources**

- *Extremely* general, works even for contingent-claims markets under uncertainty
  - Complete set of prices for all contracts that individuals trade, including contingent-contracts on future delivery of goods based on various conditions, e.g. “1 ton of Winter red wheat, delivered on 3rd of January in Minneapolis, if there is a hurricane in Florida during December”

> “More than any other contemporary economist, Samuelson has helped to raise the general analytical and methodological level in economic science. He has simply rewritten considerable parts of economic theory. He has also shown the fundamental unity of both the problems and analytical techniques in economics, partly by a systematic application of the methodology of maximization for a broad set of problems. This means that Samuelson's contributions range over a large number of different fields.” — Nobel Prize Committee

“In discissusion of economic science, “Chicago” stands for an approach that takes seriously the use of economic theory as a tool for analyzing a statingly wide range of concrete problems, rather than as an abstract mathematical structure of great beauty but little power; for an approach that insists on the empirical testing of theoretical generalizations and that rejects alike facts without theory and theory without facts,” (quoted in Landreth & Colander, p. 400)

We are dealing with a problem of a reciprocal nature. To avoid the harm to B would inflict harm on A. The real question that has to be decided is: should A be allowed to harm B or should B be allowed to harm A?” (p.2)
