- Recall: Classical writers conflated profits and interest

- Divided up society in functional terms: land, labor, capital
  - each earns a return: wages, rent, profits

- Roles of capitalist and entrepreneur often were the same person, historically

- In modern times, capitalist and entrepreneur often (but not always) different persons

- Entrepreneur *qua* .hi-turquoise[manager] of a firm does *not* earn profit, earns wage (for labor services of managing)

- .hi[“Pure profit”] must be a .hi-purple[residual] remaining after all factors of production (costs to firm) are paid
  - on competitive market in long run equilibrium, all factors are paid their marginal products, equal to opportunity cost, `\(p=MC\)`

  - real world markets are not perfectly competitive

That portion which he annually saves, as for the sake of the profit it is immediately employed as a capital, is consumed in the same manner, and nearly in the same time too, but by a different set of people, by labourers, manufacturers, and artificers, who re-produce with a profit the value of their annual consumption,” (Book II, Chapter 3).

- Marginal productivity theory &amp; product exhaustion created a problem:
  - MPT explains all revenues from firm sales ultimately go to factors of production as income (costs to firm)
  - Each factor paid its marginal product, contribution to production

- .hi-turquoise[Capital is *not an original factor*], it is just land and labor combined in the past (i.e. someone had to make the shovel, the factory, etc. with land &amp; labor)

- Marginal product of capital *should* just be the value of the land and labor used to make the capital in the past
  - But capital earns interest!

- Capital makes land &amp; labor *more* productive, maybe interest is that extra productivity?
  - But: MPT implies that labor and land each are already paid *more* from their higher marginal products (due to having the capital)!

- Interest even exists in long-run equilibrium of perfect competition (when profits disappear)

- .hi-green[Example]: “Rent” on land — compare the future flow of rental income with capitalized value (price) of land, the return is *interest*
  - Price of land capitalizes the future-discounted flow of future services (income)

&gt; “Rent and interest are merely two ways of measuring the same income,” (p.331)

- Same with labor income: obtaining higher skills will increase your future income flow, you are investing in your .hi-purple[human capital]
  - must decide if the cost is worth it, by comparing future-discounted expected income stream with vs. without skills
