But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.” (Book V, Ch. 1)

&gt; “Value has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called .hi[“value in use”]; the other, .hi[“value in exchange.”] The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce any thing; scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it.” (Book I, Ch. 6)

In exchanging the complete manufacture...for money...over and above what may be sufficient to pay the price of the materials, and the wages of the workmen, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker of the work who hazards his stock in this adventure,” (Book I, Chapter 6).

They are regulated altogether by the value of the stock employed, and are greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of this stock.”

- But he *observes* wages are *above* subsistence in England (and America)

- Because production is increasing, so is the demand for labor, and thus, wages:

&gt; “When in any country the demand for those who live by wages...is continually increasing; when every year furnishes employment for a greater number than had been employed the year before, the workmen have no occasion to combine in order to raise their wages. The scarcity of hands occasions competition among masters, who bid against one another, in order to get workmen, and thus voluntarily break through the natural combination of masters not to raise wages...It is [the continual increase in productivity], which occasions a rise in the wages of labour,” (Book I, Chapter 8).

&gt; “It deserves to be remarked, perhaps, that it is in the progressive state, while the society is advancing...that the condition of the labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and miserable in the declining state. The progressive state is in reality the cheerful and the hearty state to all the different orders of society. The stationary is dull; the declining melancholy”

&gt; “People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary,” (Book I, Chapter 9).

&gt; “As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them, come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent of land.” (Book I, Chapter 11).

&gt; When the stock which a man possesses is no more than sufficient to maintain him for a few days...His revenue is, in this case, derived from his labour only. This is the state of the greater part of the labouring poor in all countries.

&gt; [W]hen he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months or years, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater part of it; reserving only so much for his immediate consumption as may maintain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole stock, therefore, is distinguished into two parts. That part which, he expects, is to afford him this revenue, is called his capital. The other is that which supplies his immediate consumption; and which consists either, first, in that portion of his whole stock...or his revenue, from whatever source derived, as it gradually comes in

&gt; “he “stock of goods of different kinds...must be stored up...sufficient to maintain [those who participate in a division of labour which is at all advanced, supplying] with the materials and tools of his work, till such time, at least, as both these events can be brought about,” (Book II, Chapter 1).

&gt; “The labour of some of the most respectable orders in the society is, like that of menial servants, unproductive of any value, and does not fix or realize itself in any permanent subject, or vendible commodity, which endures after that labour is past, and for which an equal quantity of labour could afterwards be procured. The sovereign, for example, with all the officers both of justice and war who serve under him, the whole army and navy, are unproductive labourers. They are the servants of the public, and are maintained by a part of the annual produce of the industry of other people. Their service, how honourable, how useful, or how necessary soever, produces nothing for which an equal quantity of service can afterwards be procured,” (Book II, Chapter 3).

&gt; “Whatever a person saves from his revenue he adds to his capital, and either employs it himself in maintaining an additional number of productive hands, or enables some other person to do so, by lending it to him for an interest, that is, for a share of the profits. As the capital of an individual can be increased only by what he saves from his annual revenue...so the capital of a society, which is the same with that of all the individuals who compose it, can be increased only in the same manner,” (Book II, Chapter 3).

That portion which he annually saves, as for the sake of the profit it is immediately employed as a capital, is consumed in the same manner, and nearly in the same time too, but by a different set of people, by labourers, manufacturers, and artificers, who re-produce with a profit the value of their annual consumption,” (Book II, Chapter 3).

&gt; “The annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increased in its value by no other means, but by increasing either the number of its productive labourers, or the productive powers of those labourers who had before been employed. The number of its productive labour- ers, it is evident, can never be much increased, but in consequence of an increase of capital, or of the funds destined for maintaining them. The productive powers of the same number of labour- ers cannot be increased, but in consequence either of some addition and improvement to those machines and instruments which facilitate and abridge labour; or of a more proper division and distribution of employment. In either case an additional capital is almost always required,” (Book II, Chapter 3).

He can, in this case, neither restore the capital nor pay the interest without either alienating or encroaching upon some other source of revenue, such as the property or the rent of land,” (Book II, Chapter 3).

- Smith makes some normative judgments about lending and interest!

- Money can be lent for investment or for consumption
  - For investment is good, productive
  - For consumption is wasteful, prodigal, siphoning money away from production!

- Seems to advocate regulating interest rates
&gt; “The legal rate [of interest] … ought not to be much above the lowest market rate.”
