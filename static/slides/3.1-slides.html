- All had same idea of (what we now call) .hi[marginal utility as source of price]
  - “marginal utility” is a term invented by Menger’s student Wiser

- Menger &amp; Walras applied marginalism to production &amp; the firm

- Jevons &amp; Walras advocated mathematicization of economics

- Menger advocated subjectivism and a causal-genetic theory

- Walras condoned cardinal utility, Menger &amp; Jevons likely ordinal utility

- Debate about how much of a “revolution” it was
  - Inspiration vs. simultaneous independent discovery
  - How much of a radical departure from other writers?

- Other important predecessors that made key contributions to economic theory, often overlooked
  - Cournot, Gossen, von Thünen, Dupuit

- Controversies about discovery, credit, attribution
  - Menger independent, did not know of von Thunen, Gossen
  - Walras know of von Thunen, Gossen; wrote to Jevons, and Jevons alerted Walras to his own writings
  - Marshall supposedly writing about it in 1860s, published his Principles 30 years later

- 1838 *Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth*

- First writer to:
  - ✅ use and advocate mathematics for study of political economy
  - ✅ relate demand and supply as functions of price and quantity
  - ✅ draw a demand and supply graph
  - ✅ use marginal analysis to find profit-maximizing output: where marginal revenue `\(=\)` marginal cost

- Sadly, no influence in his lifetime

- We still use his model of oligopoly today

- Taught Auguste Walras, father of Leon Walras (and may have inspired Leon to general equilibrium theory)

  - Two firms produce an identical good (spring water), decide how much to produce (simultaneously), their joint output determines the market price
  - Game-theoretic equilibrium where firms are playing mutual best responses to one another

Major implications from Cournot:

1. As `\(\uparrow\)` number of firms: `\(\downarrow q\)`, `\(\downarrow p\)`, `\(\downarrow \pi\)`, `\((\uparrow CS\)`, `\(\downarrow DWL)\)` closer to perfect competition

2. If a firm has lower costs than others, earns greater profit; firms will want to (equivalently):
  - lower their own costs
  - raise rivals’ costs

  - `\(P\)`: subsistence of laborer and family
  - Surplus will arise on initial units of labor and capital, but diminishing returns to later units,

&gt; “Hence a thing loses its goods-character: (1) if, owing to a change in human needs, the particular needs disappear that the thing is capable of satisfying, (2) whenever the capacity of the thing to be placed in a causal connection with the satisfaction of human needs is lost as the result of a change in its own properties, (3) if knowledge of the causal connection between the thing and the satisfaction of human needs disappears, or (4) if men lose command of it so completely that they can no longer apply it directly to the satisfaction of their needs and have no means of reestablishing their power to do so,” (p.56)

&gt; “As a people attains higher levels of civilization, and as men penetrate more deeply into the true constitution of things and of their own nature, the number of true goods becomes constantly larger, and as can easily be understood, the number of imaginary goods becomes progressively smaller. It is not unimportant evidence of the connection between accurate knowledge and human welfare that the number of so-called imaginary goods is shown by experience to be usually greatest among peoples who are poorest in true goods.”

&gt; Value is thus nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, nor an independent thing existing by itself. It is a judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence, value does not exist outside the consciousness of men (pp. 120-121).

- Does not directly talk about cost or production (anticipated in his unpublished Volume 2), but he does talk about the supply side:

- Higher order goods must have complements in production in order to be useful

- .hi-purple[Imputation theory]: higher-order goods derive their value from the value of final consumption (1st order goods)

- Value of a factor of production (higher order good) is the value that would be lost if the last unit was withdrawn from production
