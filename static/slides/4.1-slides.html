# Heterodox Economics

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- We have focused thus far solidly on “orthodox economics”
  - British Classicals through marginalist revolution
  - A clear trajectory to modern economic theory (but they’re not *identical*!)

- Today we look at some famous .hi[heterodox] writers gaining traction at the same time as the marginalist revolution (mid—late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century in to early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century)

- Critical of “neoclassical” economics (Classical &amp; marginalist synthesis)
  - Critical of methodology and scope
  - Critical of worldview and ideology

# Heterodox Economics

.pull-left[

- Two (broad) heterodox schools of thought during two key eras:

- .hi[German Historical School] in central Europe
  - “Older” school in 1840s-1870s
  - “Younger” school in 1870s-1900
  - Famous “*Methodenstreit*” with Menger &amp; Austrians in 1880s
  - Dies off by 1930s

- .hi[American Institutionalists] in United States (1890s-1930s)
  - Dies off by 1930s
  - New Institutional Economics (1970s-Present)

- English Classical (and marginalist) economics did not penetrate into central Europe

- Diverse group of writers throughout 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century in German-speaking states
  - “Germany” not united until 1871

- Broadly speaking: generally placed more stock in concrete historical analysis, skeptical of “universal” principles or abstract models

# The German Historical School

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Several waves of Historicism:

- .hi[“Older School”]: Wilhelm Roscher, Karl Knies, Bruno Hildebrand (c.1840s—c.1870s)
  - anticipated by Friedrich List
  - theories of “stages of development” of countries

- .hi[“Younger School”] dominated by Gustav von Schmoller (c.1870s—1900s)
  - rejection of universal laws of economics &amp; deductive method
  - inductive and comparative, focused on time and location
  - focus on State-led policy &amp; reforms

- Classicals can *preach* all they want about Free Trade in the *abstract*, but *actual* British policy was still largely protectionist

- This protection is what made England wealthy

.quitesmall[
&gt; “Had the English left everything to itself—'Laissez faire, laissez aller', as the popular economical school recommends—the [German] merchants of the Steelyard would be still carrying on their trade in London, the Belgians would be still manufacturing cloth for the English, England would have still continued to be the sheep-farm of the Hansards, just as Portugal became the vineyard of England, and has remained so till our days, owing to the stratagem of a cunning diplomatist. Indeed, it is more than probable that without her [highly protectionist] commercial policy England would never have attained to such a large measure of municipal and individual freedom as she now possesses, for such freedom is the daughter of industry and wealth.”

# The Infant Industries Argument

.pull-left[

- List is only perhaps the most popular historical figure making what economists call the .hi[“infant industries argument”]

- Promote .hi-purple[import substitution]: specific key industries should receive special protection (via tariffs, quotas, subsidies etc.) that discourage competition (from more efficient foreign imports)

- Eventually, once the industry matures (is no longer in the “infant” stage), it can stand on its own and compete with the rest of the world, protection can be lifted

# American Institutionalism

.pull-left[
.quitesmall[
- American economists were also skeptical of British classical (and marginalist) economics

- Americans getting Ph.Ds from Germany (Historical school)
  - e.g. Clark was a student of Karl Knies

  - critical of abstract models &amp; assumptions about human behavior (i.e. rational-maximizers &amp; equilibrium)
  - focus on the role and *evolution* of social institutions, and how they affect humanity

- Largely inspired by Thorstein Veblen
  - Others: John R. Commons, Wesley C. Mitchell
  - Much later: New Institutional Economics (1970s-Present)
  
- Connected with Progressive Era ideas

The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculatior of pleasure and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact. He has neither antecedent nor consequent. He is an isolated, definitive human datum in stable equilibrium except for the buffets of the impinging forces that displace him in one direction or another.”

&gt; “The growth of culture is a cumulative sequence of habituation, and the way and means of it are the habitual response of human nature to exigencies that vary incontinently, cumulatively, but with something of a consistent sequence in the cumulative variations that so go forward—incontinently, because each new move creates a new situation which induces a further new variation in the habitual manner of response; cumulatively, because  each new situation is a variation of what has gone before it and embodies as causal factors all that has been expected by what went before; consistently, because the underlying traits of human nature (propensities, aptitudes, and what not) by force of which the response takes place...remain substantially unchanged.”

&gt; “Not only is the individual’s conduct hedged about and directed by his habitual relations to his fellows in the group, but these relations, being of an institutional character, vary as the institutional scheme varies. The wants and desires, the end and aim, the ways and means, the amplitude and drift of the individual’s conduct are functions of an institutional variable that is of a highly complex and wholly unstable character.”

- Individuals brought up in a culture act in accordance with established norms (which emerged from previous interactions)

- .hi-purple[“Instincts”]: relatively-fixed constraints &amp; motivations of human behavior
  - parental, workmanship, curiosity, acquisitiveness instincts
  - partially determined by culture

- Instinctual drives create *tensions*
  - i.e. self-interested acquisitiveness can harm society
  - Economic analysis must address this basic tension

- .hi-purple[“Industrial/technological employments”]: activities flowing from parenthood, workmanship, and curiosity
  - Involve causal, factual, relationships

- .hi-purple[“Ceremonial behavior”]: previously people explained these with religion or supernatural forces, but now science can explain them
  - rooted in the past, an appeal to authority, cultural taboos, etc.

- The more we advance science, the more we can explain without ceremonial behavior

- This major dichotomy echoes throughout Veblen’s writings

- Ceremonial behavior in modern business: .hi-purple[“pecuniary/business employments”]

- In pre-modern societies, workers owned own tools, produced via expression of workmaship instincts
  - Income from these activities roughly measures effort exerted (Smithean labor theory of value)

- In modern societies, workers and capitalists separate: acquisitiveness instinct dominates workmanship instinct
  - Captains of industry, moneylenders, “get something for nothing”

- Veblen thought they were not promoting the public good, but were amassing monopoly power

  - “Capitalization of inefficiency”

&gt; “The claim that the system of competition has proved itself an engine for making the rich richer and the poor poorer has the fascination of epigram; but if its meaning is that the lot of the average, of the masses of humanity in civilized life, is worse to-day, as measured in the means of livelihood, than it was twenty, or fifty, or a hundred years ago, then it is farcical”

- Probably best known for *Theory of the Leisure Class*

- Used dichotomy to discuss consumption

- Ceremonial instincts lead people to revere wealth and power, in modern society `\(\implies\)` wealthiest captains of industry
  - Must *display* their wealth in order to be recognized
  - People emulate wealth-displaying activity: .hi[“conspicuous consumption”] of fancy clothing, cars, houses, jewelry, private jets, etc.

- In general, Veblen saw ongoing struggle between industrial &amp; pecuniary employments, and between ceremonial instincts vs. scientific/technological improvement

- Rejected Marxist view that proletariat would become more miserable, and revolt to overthrow ruling class
  - Though it may be that working classes may *perceive* to be *relatively* poorer than richest
  - More about envy of *relative* wealth than about *actual* level of *absolute* wealth of poor

- Future is uncertain, the only certainty is change &amp; evolution
