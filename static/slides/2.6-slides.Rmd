- Ricardo hit on a fundamental principle in economics with his rent theory

- If he had applied it *beyond* land to *all factors*, and considered land as having an opportunity cost, we would essentially arrive at our modern .hi[marginal productivity theory] of production and distribution

- rent is the excess of the product over the marginal farmer paying costs to labor and capital
  - price is determined by marginal costs, but the marginal costs of the inframarginal farmer (A and B) exceed his average cost, and this excess goes to the landowner as rent

- Rent comes from scarcity of some fixed factor, and differential productivities

- Classicals treated land as a "free gift of Nature"
  - but of course, in reality, must be improved and maintained for production, 

- As homogenous land, it being fixed or scarce, creates scarcity rent: the difference between the product of all capital and labor and the product of the final dose at the intensive margin
  - If (in real life) land differs in quality, scarcity of acres of *high* quality gives rise to differential rents

- In reality, land does have a supply price that can create new land (reclaim from ocean, Netherlands, New York, etc)
  - are paying cost of using land and taking it out of alternative uses (grazing, parking lot, etc)

- From the perspective of *society*, rent is price-determined; it equalizes returns across different uses of the scarce factor (land for Ricardo)
  - implies it could be taxed away without affecting supply

- From the perspective of *a single firm*, rent is price-determining (it is a cost to the firm)
  - firm will pay 


- Cost of any input cannot be less than what input can earn in the most remunerative alternative use (opportunity cost!)
    - any earnings of input in excess of its opportunity cost = rent
    - from POV of firm, rent is a (price-determining) cost; from POV os society, they are price-determined; can be taxed away without affecting the supply of the agent

- If supply of a factor is fixed and services specific to one use, it *has no opportunity cost* and the whole of its reward is rent!
    - but no agent is ever completely nonreproducible or has no substitutes or alternative use

- In short-run, fixed capital earns quasi-rents, not interest: supply is fixed; but in long run, can change capital, so quasi-rents always eroded

- Wages fund is paid to labor out of capital

But to buy, one must have wherewithal to pay. It is obviously therefore the collective means of payment which exist in the whole nation that constitute the entire market of the nation. But wherein consist the collective means of payment of the whole nation? Do they not consist in its annual produce, in the annual revenue of the general mass of its inhabitants? But if a nation’s power of purchasing is exactly measured by its annual produce, as it undoubtedly is; the more you increase the annual produce, the more by that very act you extend the national market, the power of purchasing and the actual purchases of the nation...[T]he demand of a nation is always equal to the produce of a nation”
