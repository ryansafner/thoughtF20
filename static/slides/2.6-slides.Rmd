- Ricardo hit on a fundamental principle in economics with his rent theory

- If he had applied it *beyond* land to *all factors*, and considered land as having an opportunity cost, we would essentially arrive at our modern .hi[marginal productivity theory] of production and distribution

- rent is the excess of the product over the marginal farmer paying costs to labor and capital
  - price is determined by marginal costs, but the marginal costs of the inframarginal farmer (A and B) exceed his average cost, and this excess goes to the landowner as rent

- Rent comes from scarcity of some fixed factor, and differential productivities

- Classicals treated land as a "free gift of Nature"
  - but of course, in reality, must be improved and maintained for production, 

- As homogenous land, it being fixed or scarce, creates scarcity rent: the difference between the product of all capital and labor and the product of the final dose at the intensive margin
  - If (in real life) land differs in quality, scarcity of acres of *high* quality gives rise to differential rents

- In reality, land does have a supply price that can create new land
  - are paying cost of using land and taking it out of alternative uses (grazing, parking lot, etc)

$$\text{real wage} = \frac{\text{wages fund}}{\text{labor force}}$$

- If wages fund increases (from capital accumulation), real wages rise in short run

> ‚ÄúIn this last case [economic depression], it is commonly said that there is a general superabundance...[The proposition that aggregate supply equals aggregate demand] is evidently founded on the supposition of a state of barter...When two persons perform an act of barter, each of them is at once a seller and a buyer. He cannot sell without buying.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúIf however, we suppose that money is used, these propositions cease to be exactly true...[T]he effect of the employment of money...is, that it enables this one act of interchange to be divided into two separate acts or operations...Although he who sells, really sells only to buy, he needs not buy at the same moment when he sells; and he does not therefore necessarily add to the immediate demand for one commodity when he adds to the supply of another...[T]here may be...a very general inclination to sell with as little delay as possible, accompanied with an equally general inclination to defer all purchases as long as possible....to render the argument for the impossibility of an excess of all commodities applicable to the case in which a circulating medium is employed, money must itself be considered as a commodity [in demand and supply]. It must, undoubtedly, be admitted .hi[there cannot be an excess of all other commodities, and an excess of money at the same time].‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe encouragement of mere consumption is no benefit to commerce; for the difficulty lies in supplying the means, not in stimulating the desire of consumption; and we have seen that production alone furnishes those means. Thus, it is the aim of good government to stimulate production, of bad government to encourage consumption,‚Äù I.XV.20

- The first great controversy in economics

- Ricardo clearly ‚Äúwon‚Äù the debate, but a mere band-aid for classical theory in LR
  - Latched onto simplified version, additional assumptions
  - but his position was more logically consistent and impressive

- Malthus could not articulate his opposition well, and had no alternative theory
  - was correct that *something was wrong*
  - *could have* provided a monetary theory of depressions, but didn‚Äôt
  - was forgotten for a century, revived by Keynes
