- Harm is often .hi[bilateral], not unilateral

- Takes two parties to have a dispute
- A `\(\iff\)` B

- Origin of the problem is rights are not clear (undefined or unenforced)!

- Who has right/responsibility over activity creating the external harm?

# The "Coase Theorem"

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- .hi[Coase Theorem]: if transactions costs are low, clearly defined property rights allow parties to bargain to the efficient social outcome *regardless* of who has the property right

- Wealth and **distribution** effects *will* change (who pays who)

- If there are mutual gains from exchange to be had, parties will find a way to capture them
  - Resources will flow towards highest-valued uses
  - Coase: there's nothing new here if you understand Adam Smith!

- Go back to lessons

- [1.1 — Introduction](/class/1.1-class)
- [1.2 — What Exactly Is Economics?](/class/1.2-class)

and reconsider:
  - orthodox vs. heterodox economics
  - proper scope and methodology of economics
  - what is economics?
