In how little time, therefore, must this bring back the money which we had lost, and raise us to the level of all the neighbouring nations? Where, after we arrived, we immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of labour and commodities; and the farther flowing in of money is stopped by our fulness and repletion,” (pp.146-147 in *Reader*)

- Critiques (without naming) Hume’s mere ‘mechanical’ version of sympathy as a mere transfer of emotion
  - seeing another person angry does not make us angry (unless we learn of what prompted the anger)

- Only once we place ourselves in their shoes can we sympathize with their emotion

- We can judge whether another’s emotion was *warranted* by the stimulus
  - the .hi-purple[propriety] or .hi-purple[impropriety] of others’ actions

- The easiest person to fool is *yourself*

&gt; “This self-deceit, this fatal weakness of mankind, is the source of half the disorders of human life. If we saw ourselves in the light in which others see us, or in which they would see us if they knew all, a reformation would generally be unavoidable. We could not otherwise endure the sight.”

- We internalize propriety via the .hi[impartial spectator] 

&gt; “We suppose ourselves the .hi[spectators of our own behaviour], and endeavour to imagine what effect it would, in this light, produce upon us. This is the only looking glass by which we can, in some measure, with the eyes of other people, .hi[scrutinize the propriety of our own conduct].”

&gt; “It is from him only that we learn the real littleness of ourselves, and of whatever relates to ourselves, and the natural misrepresentations of self-love can be corrected only by the eye of this .hi[impartial spectator]. It is he who shows us the propriety of generosity and the deformity of injustice; the propriety of resigning the greatest interests of our own, for the yet greater interests of others...”

&gt; “In the courts of princes, in the drawing-rooms of the great, where success and preferment depend, not upon the esteem of intelligent and well-informed equals, but upon the fanciful and foolish favour of ignorant, presumptuous, and proud superiors; flattery and falsehood too often prevail over merit and abilities.”

&gt; “We frequently see the respectful attentions of the world more strongly directed towards the rich and great, than towards the wise and virtuous.”

&gt; “Are you in earnest resolved never to barter your liberty for the lordly servitude of a court, but to live free, fearless, and independent? There seems to be one way to continue in that virtuous resolution....hi[Never enter the place from whence so few have been able to return; never come within the circle of ambition]; nor ever bring yourself into comparison with those masters of the earth who have already engrossed the attention of half mankind before you.”

He is enchanted with the distant idea of this felicity. It appears in his fancy like the life of some superior rank of beings, and, in order to arrive at it, he devotes himself for ever to the pursuit of wealth and greatness...With the most unrelenting industry he labours night and day to acquire talents superior to all his competitors...For this purpose he makes his court to all mankind; he serves those whom he hates, and is obsequious to those whom he despises...”

It is then, in the last dregs of life, his body wasted with toil and diseases, his mind galled and ruffled by the memory of a thousand injuries and disappointments which he imagines he has met with from the injustice of his enemies, or from the perfidy and ingratitude of his friends, that he begins at last to find that wealth and greatness are mere trinkets of frivolous utility, no more adapted for procuring ease of body or tranquility of mind than the tweezer-cases of the lover of toys; and like them too, more troublesome to the person who carries them about with him than all the advantages they can afford him are commodious.”

&gt; “And .hi[it is well that nature imposes upon us in this manner]. It is this deception which .hi[rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of mankind]. It is this which first prompted them to cultivate the ground, to build houses, to found cities and commonwealths, and to invent and improve all the sciences and arts, which ennoble and embellish human life; which have entirely changed the whole face of the globe, have turned the rude forests of nature into agreeable and fertile plains, and made the trackless and barren ocean a new fund of subsistence, and the great high road of communication to the different nations of the earth. The earth by these labours of mankind has been obliged to redouble her natural fertility, and to maintain a greater multitude of inhabitants...They are .hi[led by an invisible hand]...hi[.without intending it, without knowing it], .hi[advance the interest of the society], and afford means to the multiplication of the species”

&gt; The man of system...is apt to be very wise in his own conceit; and is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it...He seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board. He does not consider that...in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might chuse to impress upon it...If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder,” (Book IV, Ch. II)
