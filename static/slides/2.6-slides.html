- Ricardo hit on a fundamental principle in economics with his rent theory

- If he had applied it *beyond* land to *all factors*, and considered land as having an opportunity cost, we would essentially arrive at our modern .hi[marginal productivity theory] of production and distribution

- rent is the excess of the product over the marginal farmer paying costs to labor and capital
  - price is determined by marginal costs, but the marginal costs of the inframarginal farmer (A and B) exceed his average cost, and this excess goes to the landowner as rent

- Rent comes from scarcity of some fixed factor, and differential productivities

- Classicals treated land as a "free gift of Nature"
  - but of course, in reality, must be improved and maintained for production, 

- As homogenous land, it being fixed or scarce, creates scarcity rent: the difference between the product of all capital and labor and the product of the final dose at the intensive margin
  - If (in real life) land differs in quality, scarcity of acres of *high* quality gives rise to differential rents

- In reality, land does have a supply price that can create new land (reclaim from ocean, Netherlands, New York, etc)
  - are paying cost of using land and taking it out of alternative uses (grazing, parking lot, etc)

- From the perspective of *society*, rent is price-determined; it equalizes returns across different uses of the scarce factor (land for Ricardo)
  - implies it could be taxed away without affecting supply

- From the perspective of *a single firm*, rent is price-determining (it is a cost to the firm)
  - firm will pay 


- Cost of any input cannot be less than what input can earn in the most remunerative alternative use (opportunity cost!)
    - any earnings of input in excess of its opportunity cost = rent
    - from POV of firm, rent is a (price-determining) cost; from POV os society, they are price-determined; can be taxed away without affecting the supply of the agent

- If supply of a factor is fixed and services specific to one use, it *has no opportunity cost* and the whole of its reward is rent!
    - but no agent is ever completely nonreproducible or has no substitutes or alternative use

- In short-run, fixed capital earns quasi-rents, not interest: supply is fixed; but in long run, can change capital, so quasi-rents always eroded

&gt; ‚ÄúWe see in almost every part of the world vast powers of production which are not put into action...From the want of a proper distribution of the actual produce adequate motives are not furnished to continue production...I don‚Äôt at all wish to deny that some persons or others are entitled to consume all that is produced; but the grand question is whether it is distributed in such a manner between the different parties concerned as to occasion the most effective demand for future produce: and I distinctly maintain that an attempt to accumulate very rapidly which necessarily implies a considerable diminution of unproductive consumption by greatly impairing the usual motives to production must prematurely check the progress of wealth,‚Äù

- Insufficient .hi-purple[effectual demand] can cause general gluts

&gt; ‚ÄúIt has appeared then that, in the ordinary state of society, the master producers and capitalists, though they may have the power, have not had the will, to consume to the necessary extent. And with regard to their workmen, it must be allowed that, if they possessed the will, they have not the power.‚Äù

- Workers don‚Äôt earn enough to have high effectual demand

- Capitalists don‚Äôt spend their money on consumption, at worst they merely save (and hoard), or at best they invest it

- For Ricardo, saving `\(=\)` investment

&gt; ‚ÄúI deny that the wants of the consumers generally are diminished by parsimony‚Äîthey are transferred with the power to consume to another set of consumers.‚Äù

- Thus:

`$$\begin{align*}
\text{demand for final goods} &amp; = \text{supply of final goods}\\
\text{factor payments} - \text{saving} &amp; = \text{output} - \text{investment}\\

- Ricardo‚Äôs restatement of Say‚Äôs Law:

&gt; ‚ÄúWhoever is possessed of a commodity is necessarily a demander, either he wishes to consume the commodity himself, and then no purchaser is wanted; or he wishes to sell it, and purchase some other thing with the money, which shall either be consumed by him, or be made instrumental to future production‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúWhat I wish to impress on the readers mind is that it is at all times the bad adaptation of the commodities produced to the wants of mankind which is the specific evil, and not the abundance of commodities. Demand is only limited by the will and power to purchase. Whoever has commodities has the power to consume.‚Äù

.quitesmall[
&gt; ‚ÄúIf the people entitled to consume will not consume the commodities produced...and consequently a general stagnation of trade has ensued, we cannot do better than follow the advice of Mr. Malthus, and oblige the Government to supply the deficiency of the people. We ought in that case to petition the King to...more effectually promote the best interests of the country by promoting public extravagance and expenditure. We are it seems a nation of producers and have few consumers amongst us, and the evil has at last become of that magnitude that we shall be irretrievably miserable if the parliament or the ministers do not immediately adopt an efficient plan of expenditure.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúFor what, in point of fact, do you want the money? Is it not for the purchase of raw materials or stock for your trade, or victuals for your support? Wherefore, it is products that you want, and not money.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúSales cannot be said to be dull because money is scarce, but because other products are so.‚Äù

- But in truth, sales in general *can* be dull (in short run) if there is an excess demand *for money*
  - people spend less to acquire more desired money balances
  - in aggregate, pushes down price level

- Say assumed price level wouldn‚Äôt need to adjust, because of gold standard and Hume‚Äôs price-specie flow mechanism:

.pull-right[
.smallest[
- The first great controversy in economics

- Ricardo clearly ‚Äúwon‚Äù the debate, but a mere band-aid for classical theory in LR
  - Latched onto simplified version, additional assumptions
  - but his position was more logically consistent and impressive

- Malthus could not articulate his opposition well, and had no alternative theory
  - was correct that *something was wrong*
  - *could have* provided a monetary theory of depressions, but didn‚Äôt
  - was forgotten for a century, revived by John Maynard Keynes during Great Depression
