- Ricardo hit on a fundamental principle in economics with his rent theory

- If he had applied it *beyond* land to *all factors*, and considered land as having an opportunity cost, we would essentially arrive at our modern .hi[marginal productivity theory] of production and distribution

- rent is the excess of the product over the marginal farmer paying costs to labor and capital
  - price is determined by marginal costs, but the marginal costs of the inframarginal farmer (A and B) exceed his average cost, and this excess goes to the landowner as rent

- Rent comes from scarcity of some fixed factor, and differential productivities

- Classicals treated land as a "free gift of Nature"
  - but of course, in reality, must be improved and maintained for production, 

- As homogenous land, it being fixed or scarce, creates scarcity rent: the difference between the product of all capital and labor and the product of the final dose at the intensive margin
  - If (in real life) land differs in quality, scarcity of acres of *high* quality gives rise to differential rents

- In reality, land does have a supply price that can create new land
  - are paying cost of using land and taking it out of alternative uses (grazing, parking lot, etc)

  - a .hi-purple[“psychological subsistence”] level rather than a “physical” subsistence level (i.e. minimal caloric inake)
  - varies by culture and time, minimal “acceptable level” of well-being

- Like Smith, Ricardo showed that capital accumulation can increase wages, and hoped that accumulation would continue (faster than population growth)
  - and have workers experience higher quality of life, so the minimal “psychological subsistence” level can increase

- Believes that landlords can prop up effectual demand

&gt; “Every society must have a body of unproductive labourers; as every society...must have statesmen to govern it, soldiers to defend it, judges and lawyers to administer justice and protect the rights of individuals…No civilized state has ever been known to exist without a certain portion of all these classes of society in addition to those who are directly employed in production.”

- Landlords don’t contribute to production, but (wastefully, in the eyes of Smith and Ricardo) spend their high rents on consumption and luxuries

- Perhaps even government (though he is cautious and skeptical) can prop up effectual demand

&gt; “The government would function as another perfect outlet to stimulate consumption, contributing nothing to production and only consuming resources, since it cannot be denied that they contributed powerfully to distribution and demand...they ensure that consumption which is necessary to give proper stimulus to production...”

- Ricardo in the bullionist debates, took a hard monetarist position: 
  - inflation was always a monetary phenomenon
  - money is just a veil hiding real economic activities that determine output
  - opposition to the real bills doctrine (which thought inflation came from *real*, not *monetary* factors), suspicion of excess paper currency

- Overshadowed Henry Thornton, who was a more careful economist and saw the possibility of monetary disequilibrium

- For Ricardo, saving `\(=\)` investment

&gt; “I deny that the wants of the consumers generally are diminished by parsimony—they are transferred with the power to consume to another set of consumers.”

- Thus:

`$$\begin{align*}
\text{demand for final goods} &amp; = \text{supply of final goods}\\
\text{factor payments} - \text{saving} &amp; = \text{output} - \text{investment}\\

- Ricardo’s restatement of Say’s Law:

&gt; “Whoever is possessed of a commodity is necessarily a demander, either he wishes to consume the commodity himself, and then no purchaser is wanted; or he wishes to sell it, and purchase some other thing with the money, which shall either be consumed by him, or be made instrumental to future production”

&gt; “What I wish to impress on the readers mind is that it is at all times the bad adaptation of the commodities produced to the wants of mankind which is the specific evil, and not the abundance of commodities. Demand is only limited by the will and power to purchase. Whoever has commodities has the power to consume.”

- There can be, and often are, gluts in *individual* markets

.quitesmall[
&gt; “If the people entitled to consume will not consume the commodities produced...and consequently a general stagnation of trade has ensued, we cannot do better than follow the advice of Mr. Malthus, and oblige the Government to supply the deficiency of the people. We ought in that case to petition the King to...more effectually promote the best interests of the country by promoting public extravagance and expenditure. We are it seems a nation of producers and have few consumers amongst us, and the evil has at last become of that magnitude that we shall be irretrievably miserable if the parliament or the ministers do not immediately adopt an efficient plan of expenditure.”

- .hi-purple[Say’s law assumes monetary equilibrium]

&gt; “For what, in point of fact, do you want the money? Is it not for the purchase of raw materials or stock for your trade, or victuals for your support? Wherefore, it is products that you want, and not money.”

&gt; “Sales cannot be said to be dull because money is scarce, but because other products are so.”

- But in truth, sales in general *can* be dull (in short run) if there is an excess demand *for money*
  - people spend less to acquire more desired money balances
  - in aggregate, pushes down price level

- Sales *can* be dull with an excess demand for money

- People demand to hold more money (lower exchange value), stop spending money

- Decreased spending depresses sales, lowers price level (P), but raising purchasing power (PPM)

- Response:
  - under gold standard, gold flows in, or people mine more gold (more valuable)
  - under fiat standard ❓❓

&gt; “In such cases, merchants know well enough how to find substitutes for the product serving as the medium of exchange or money: and money itself soon pours in, for this reason, that all produce naturally gravitates to that place where it is most in demand”

- Say assumed price level wouldn’t need to adjust, because of gold standard and Hume’s price-specie flow mechanism:
  - excess demand for money would cause gold inflows (and more gold mining)

- But in non-gold standard (or fiat) economy, price level must adjust

- The first great controversy in economics

- Ricardo clearly “won” the debate, but a mere band-aid for classical theory in LR
  - Latched onto simplified version, additional assumptions
  - but his position was more logically consistent and impressive

- Malthus could not articulate his opposition well, and had no alternative theory
  - was correct that *something was wrong*
  - *could have* provided a monetary theory of depressions, but didn’t
  - was forgotten for a century, revived by Keynes
