- What role do costs of production (payments to factors) play in value of final goods?

- Costs are the values which are forgone in directing resources to a particular production process rather than other production processes

- In this sense, production costs are really a reflection of utilities elsewhere in the economy

- Beginnings of major disagreements:

- Jevons always thought costs were “real” in some sense, e.g. the *disutility* or pain of labor
  - utility of consumption vs. disutility of production; utility &amp; disutility curves

- Marshall &amp; Edgeworth would later argue you can derive an upward-sloping supply/cost curve for non-land factors by disutility of use

- Menger had clear insights about capital and production: goods of higher order, their complementarity and substitutability, etc.

- If we all agree that prices of final goods reflect their marginal utility, how do we price factor services (land, labor, capital)?

- Wieser’s solution was .hi-purple[linear programming] with simultaneous equations (no calculus)

- .hi-green[Example]: consider a three-good society, factors in each good’s production are `\(x\)`, `\(y\)`, and `\(z\)`, represented by three simultaneous equations:

`$$\begin{align*}
x+y&amp;=\$100\\
2x+3z&amp;=\$290\\
4y+5z&amp;=\$590\\ \end{align*}$$

- Solve for `\(x\)`, `\(y\)`, and `\(z\)` (prices of each factor)

- Assumes prices for final goods are given, fixed production coefficients, and no substitution of factors

# Derived Demand in Factor Markets

  - Firm only demands inputs to the extent they **contribute to producing sellable output**

- Firm faces a .hi-purple[tradeoff] when **hiring more labor**, as more labor `\(\Delta L\)` creates:

  2. .hi[Marginal Cost]: Increases costs

# Marginal Revenue Product (of Labor)

- Hiring more labor increases output (i.e. labor's .hi-purple[`\\(MP_L\\)`])
  - Recall: `\(MP_L=\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta L}\)`, where `\(q\)` is units of output

--

- Additional output generates (i.e. labor's .hi-purple[`\\(MR(q)\\)`])
  - Recall: `\(MR(q)=\frac{\Delta R(q)}{\Delta q}\)`, where `\(R(q)\)` is total revenue
--

- Hiring more labor, on the **margin**, generates a **benefit**, called the .hi[marginal revenue product of labor, `\\(MRP_L\\)`]:
`$$MRP_L=MP_L* MR(q)$$`
  - i.e. the number of new products a new worker makes times the revenue earned by selling the new products

`$$MRP_L=MP_L*p$$`

- Uses Euler’s Theorem of homogeneous functions to prove product exhaustion under specific conditions:
  - production functions must be linearly homogenous (degree 1)
  - we would say: .hi-purple[constant returns to scale]
  - `\(cY =f(cL,cK,cT)\)`

# Returns to Scale

- The .hi[returns to scale] of production refers to the change in output when all inputs are increased *at the same rate*

--

- .hi-purple[Constant returns to scale]: output increases at same proportionate rate as inputs increase
    - e.g. if you double all inputs, output doubles

--

- .hi-purple[Increasing returns to scale]: output increases *more than* proportionately to the change in inputs
    - e.g. if you double all inputs, output *more than* doubles

--

- .hi-purple[Decreasing returns to scale]: output increases *less than* proportionately to the change in inputs
    - e.g. if you double all inputs, output *less than* doubles

- Most economists believed that an industry would always be either constant, increasing, or decreasing returns

- Wicksell showed that most .hi-purple[firms actually go through all three phases of returns to scale]
  - developing a .hi-purple[long-run U-shaped average cost curve] for a firm
  - would take a few decades for neoclassical economists to derive and understand shape of AC curve

- Thus, it is *not* necessary (as Wicksteed did) to assume constant returns to prove product exhaustion

- Competition would ensure that in the long run, firms are producing at their least-cost combination
  - `\(p = MC = AC_{min}\)`
  - `\(\pi = 0\)`
  - “product exhaustion”

- Think about what you learn in microeconomics

- In perfect competition, in the long run, as profits attract entrants and losses force exits, price settles on the break-even point, where profit is 0
  - `\(p=MC=AC_{min}\)`

- We still haven’t gotten to the famous model of perfect competition, but this is where everything is heading
