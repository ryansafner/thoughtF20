- .hi[“Older School”]: Wilhelm Roscher, Karl Knies, Bruno Hildebrand (c.1840s—c.1870s)

- .hi[“Younger School”] dominated by Gustav von Schmoller (c.1870s—1900s)
  - rejection of universal laws of economics & deductive method
  - inductive and comparative, focused on time and location
  - focus on State-led policy & reforms

Indeed, it is more than probable that without her [highly protectionist] commercial policy England would never have attained to such a large measure of municipal and individual freedom as she now possesses, for such freedom is the daughter of industry and wealth.”

- Eventually, once the industry matures (is no longer in the “infant” stage), it can stand on its own and compete with the rest of the world, protection can be lifted

> “The psychological and athropological preconceptions of the economists have been those which were accepted by the psychological and social sciences some generations ago. The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculatior of pleasure and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact. He has neither antecedent nor consequent. He is an isolated, definitive human datum in stable equilibrium except for the buffets of the impinging forces that displace him in one direction or another.”

> “The growth of culture is a cumulative sequence of habituation, and the way and means of it are the habitual response of human nature to exigencies that vary incontinently, cumulatively, but with something of a consistent sequence in the cumulative variations that so go forward—incontinently, because each new move creates a new situation which induces a further new variation in the habitual manner of response; cumulatively, because  each new situation is a variation of what has gone before it and embodies as causal factors all that has been expected by what went before; consistently, because the underlying traits of human nature (propensities, aptitudes, and what not) by force of which the response takes place...remain substantially unchanged.”

> “Not only is the individual’s conduct hedged about and directed by his habitual relations to his fellows in the group, but these relations, being of an institutional character, vary as the institutional scheme varies. The wants and desires, the end and aim, the ways and means, the amplitude and drift of the individual’s conduct are functions of an institutional variable that is of a highly complex and wholly unstable character.”

- Individuals brought up in a culture act in accordance with established norms (which emerged from previous interactions)

- .hi-purple[“Instincts”]: relatively-fixed constraints & motivations of human behavior
  - parental, workmanship, curiosity, acquisitiveness instincts
  - partially determined by culture

- Instinctual drives create *tensions*
  - i.e. self-interested acquisitiveness can harm society
  - Economic analysis must address this basic tension

- .hi-purple[“Industrial/technological employments”]: activities flowing from parenthood, workmanship, and curiosity
  - Involve causal, factual, relationships

- .hi-purple[“Ceremonial behavior”]: previously people explained these with religion or supernatural forces, but now science can explain them
  - rooted in the past, an appeal to authority, cultural taboos, etc.

- The more we advance science, the more we can explain without ceremonial behavior

- This major dichotomy echoes throughout Veblen’s writings

- In pre-modern societies, workers owned own tools, produced via expression of workmaship instincts
  - Income from these activities roughly measures effort exerted (Smithean labor theory of value)

- In modern societies, workers and capitalists separate: acquisitiveness instinct dominates workmanship instinct
  - Captains of industry, moneylenders, “get something for nothing”

  - “Capitalization of inefficiency”

> “The claim that the system of competition has proved itself an engine for making the rich richer and the poor poorer has the fascination of epigram; but if its meaning is that the lot of the average, of the masses of humanity in civilized life, is worse to-day, as measured in the means of livelihood, than it was twenty, or fifty, or a hundred years ago, then it is farcical”

- Probably best known for *Theory of the Leisure Class*

- Used dichotomy to discuss consumption

- Ceremonial instincts lead people to revere wealth and power, in modern society $\implies$ wealthiest captains of industry
  - Must *display* their wealth in order to be recognized
  - People emulate wealth-displaying activity: .hi[“conspicuous consumption”] of fancy clothing, cars, houses, jewelry, private jets, etc.

- In general, Veblen saw ongoing struggle between industrial & pecuniary employments, and between ceremonial instincts vs. scientific/technological improvement

- Rejected Marxist view that proletariat would become more miserable, and revolt to overthrow ruling class
  - Though it may be that working classes may *perceive* to be *relatively* poorer than richest
  - More about envy of *relative* wealth than about *actual* level of *absolute* wealth of poor

- Future is uncertain, the only certainty is change & evolution
