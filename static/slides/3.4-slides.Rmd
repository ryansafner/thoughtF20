- An academic, trained in mathematics
  - sought to transform Ricardo & Mill into mathematics

- Guided by deep humanitarian need to improve the lives of the poor

- Became professor of political economy at Cambridge
  - forged a generation of new students: Pigou, Keynes, Edgeworth, etc.

- Biggest goal was to make economics a separate & well-known discipline, accessible to the public and the business world
  - influenced his methodology and his (lack of) policy positions
  - synthesized many schools of thought; tried to please everyone, which led to attacks on all sides
  - endless questions about “what he really meant”

- Very patient, thoughtful thinker and writer

- Supposedly discovered marginalism in 1860s, but tested and refined it with his students, didn’t publish until 1890

> [Keynes on marginalist revolution]: “Jevons saw the kettle boil and cried out with the delighted voice of a child; Marshall too had seen the kettle boil and sat down silently to build an engine.”

- His *Principles of Economics* went through 8 editions, and was the most popular economics textbook until Paul Samuelson’s in 1948

> “But I know I had a growing feeling in the later years of my work at the subject that a good mathematical theorem dealing with economic hypotheses was very unlikely to be good economics: and I went more and more on the rules—(1) Use mathematics as a shorthand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry. (2) Keep to them until you have done. (3) Translate into English. (4) Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life. (5) Burn the mathematics. (6) If you can’t succeed in (4), burn (3). This last I did often.”

- His definitions of concepts are not very neat or tidy, but *practical*

- Again, goal of appealing to businesspeople and the educated public, not technical specialists

- Instead of the sharp Classical division of land vs. labor vs. capital, Marshall: .hi[“the factors of production”]

- For theory of the firm, “we shall have to study the expenses of a .hi[representative producer]”
  - not a statistical average, but a realistically-surveyed firm of normal ability and access to technology

> “[In terms of long run equilibrium,] nothing of this is true in the world in which we live. Here every economic force is constantly changing its action, under the influence of other forces which are acting around it. Here changes in the volume of production, in its method, and its cost are ever mutually modifying one another; they are always affecting and being affected by the character and the extent of demand. Further all these mutual influences take time to work themselves out, and, as a rule, no two influences move at an equal pace. In this world therefore every plain and simple doctrine as to the relations between costs of production, demand and value is necessarily false: and the greater the appearance of lucidity which is given to it by skillful exposition, the more mischievous it is. A man is likely to be a better economist if he trusts to his common sense, and practical instincts, than if he professes to study the theory of value and is resolved to find it easy.”

- It’s futile to argue whether demand or supply determines the price:

> “We might as reasonably dispute whether it is the upper or under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper, as whether value is governed by utility or costs of production. It is true that when one blade is held still, and the cutting is effected by moving the other, we may say with careless brevity that the cutting is done by the second; but the statement is not strictly accurate, and is to be excused only so long as it claims to be merely a popular and not a strictly scientific account of what happens.”

  - Quantity adjusts to price

- For better or worse (debatable!), we’ve used Marshall’s version ever since

- The marginal utility of a good is equal to its price times the “marginal utility of money”:

$$MU_a=p_a * MU_m$$

- Marginal utility of money $(MU_m)$: marginal utility received from last dollar spent (or earned, if we consider “savings” a good)

- Most important task was to explain shape of demand curves: .hi[law of demand]

> “The amount demanded increases with a fall in price, and dminishes with a rise in price.”

- Diminishing marginal utility (Gossen’s first law) $\implies$ downward sloping demand

- Optimum condition for maximizing utility: consumer will equalize the marginal utility on the last dollar spent on each good
  - Gossen’s second law/equimarginal principle:
  - Marshall: equates to the marginal utility of money, $MU_m$
  
$$\frac{MU_a}{p_a} = \frac{MU_b}{p_b} = \frac{MU_c}{p_c} = MU_m$$

- Problems with Marshallian demand theory:
  - ignores (real) income effects (substitution effect only)
  - what about an inferior good? Does it have a downward sloping demand curve?
  - Giffen good example: upward sloping demand!

- Marshall first defines .hi[consumers’ surplus]

$$MU_a = p_a \times MU_m$$

- Implies that $p_a = \frac{MU_a}{MU_m}$: price directly can measure marginal utility

- Consumers willing to pay more for earlier-consumed units of a good than for later-consumed units
  - But consumers are able to buy all the units they want at one price in the market
  - Gain from inframarginal units (paid less than what they would be willing to pay): surplus or “rent” to consumers
