- The breadth and influence of Smith's *Wealth of Nations (WON)* is incredible
  - theory + history + analogies + policy recommendations
  - borrows concepts from others, but unique in systematization, style, & vision
  
- Everyone should read Smith, those with an interest in economics should read all the Smith you can get your hands on
  - readable, entertaining, insightful

- political freedom and economic freedom

- Equality, pluralism, and cosmopolitanism
  - against class & privilege (remnants of feudal tyranny)
  - A society of “contract” rather than a society of “status”

- “Liberal” in U.S. politics today is correlated with, but quite different from, “classical liberalism”

> As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can ... to employ his capital [in] that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry ... and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention...By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it., (Book IV, Chapter 2: Of restraints upon the importation from foreign countries of such goods as can be produced at home).

> Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium. Both suppositions are false. A trade which is forced by means of bounties and monopolies may be and commonly is disadvantageous to the country in whose favour it is meant to be established, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter.  But that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on between any two places is always advantageous, though not always equally so, to both., (Book IV, Chapter 3: Of the extraordinary Restraints upon the Importation of Goods of almost all Kinds, from those Countries with which the Balance is supposed to be Disadvantageous, Part II).

> [A]ccording to the theory of the balance of trade, France has a quite simple means of doubling her capital at any moment.  It suffices merely to pass its products through the customhouse, and then throw them into the sea.  In that case the exports will equal the amount of her capital; imports will be nonexistent and even impossible, and we shall gain all that the ocean has swallowed up, ([The Balance of Trade](http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss13.html\#Chapter 13l) 1848).

> Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. The maxim is so perfectly self-evident that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it. But in the mercantile system the interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce., (Book IV, Chapter 9: Conclusion of the Mercantile system).
