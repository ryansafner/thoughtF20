- If Ricardo and his allies could show:
  1. increased investment in agriculture had *diminishing returns*, and 
  2. price of corn was partially determined by quantity of labor used in production

- Then they could show that high price of corn was caused by extension of cultivation and increase of labor needed to produce more marginal land
  - Inefficient use of labor, better for England to import corn from abroad!

- Malthus writes a pamphlet defending the Corn laws

- In process, writes a pamphlet *Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent* (1815)

  1. Land produces a surplus over the expenses of cultivation
  2. This surplus always creates new demand (and boosts population)
  3. The most fertile land is scarce

- Rent is a useful social institution

- Only Malthus’ reason #3 makes any sense, rent is only paid because of the “[fickleness] of nature in providing fertile land”, and rent is only profits transferred away from capitalists to landlords

&gt; “If all land had the same properties, if it were unlimited in quantity, and uniform in quality, no charge could be made for its use, unless where it possessed peculiar advantages of situation...It is only, then, because land is not unlimited in quantity and uniform in quality...that rent is ever paid for the use of it.”

- Ricardo believes landlords are in fact always *opposed* to the interests of society

.quitesmall[
&gt; “If the interests of the landlord be of sufficient consequence, to determine us not to avail ourselves of all the benefits which would follow from importing corn at a cheap price, they should also influence us in rejecting all improvements in agriculture, and in the implements of husbandry; for it is as certain that corn is rendered cheap, rents are lowered, and the ability of the landlord to pay taxes, is for a time, at least, as much impaired by such improvements, as by the importation of corn. To be consistent then, let us by the same act arrest improvement, and prohibit importation.”

&gt; “To produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labour of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the
same country, might require the labour of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth. This exchange might even take place, notwithstanding that the commodity imported by Portugal could be produced there with less labour than in England. Though she could make the cloth with the labour of 90 men, she would import it from a country where it required the labour of 100 men to produce it, because it would be advantageous to her rather to employ her capital in the production of wine, for which she would obtain more cloth from England, than she could produce by diverting a portion of her capital from the cultivation of vines to the manufacture of cloth.”

- Even in the presence of .hi[absolute advantage] (one country is more efficient at producing *all* goods), still better for them to specialize

- Pay others to perform a task, or purchase a good, and specialize in producing goods where you have the .hi-purple[lowest opportunity cost]

&gt; "[Repealing the Corn laws would solve four problems.] First, it would guarantee the prosperity of the manufacturer by affording him outlets for his products. Second, it would relieve the Condition of England question by cheapening the price of food and ensuring more regular employment. Third, it would make English agriculture more efficient by stimulating demand for its products in urban and industrial areas. Fourth, it would introduce through mutually advantageous international trade a new era of international fellowship and peace. The only barrier to these four beneficent solutions was the ignorant self-interest of the landlords, the "bread-taxing oligarchy, unprincipled, unfeeling, rapacious and plundering."

- “Rent” to landowner in everyday language is not precise!
  - Contains both elements of “profits” and “rents” (payment for land improvements)

&gt; “If, then, good land existed in quantity much more abundant than the production of food for an increasing population required, or if capital could be indefinitely employed without a diminished return on the old land, there could be no rise of rent; for rent invariably proceeds from the employment of an additional quantity of labour with a proportionally less return.”

- Example adapted from Blaug (1996)

- Suppose the price of corn is $1 per bushel
  - so marginal physical product = marginal value product (just add a $ in front)

- Price of one homogenous unit of K+L (“man-with-shovel”) is $100

- Assume each farmer (A, B, C) will apply a K+L dose so long as `\(MR&gt;MC\)`

# Ricardian Rents

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Rent comes from differential productivities of land]

- .hi-purple[Rent] to equalize the profits of plots A, B, and C
  - C: $0 
  - B: $10
  - A: $30

- Rent on any plot = differences between marginal product of dose of L&amp;K at intensive margin and the marginal product of earlier, inframarginal doses

- In Ricardian theory, the .hi-purple[fixed factor of production] (land) earns all inframarginal residuals, i.e. gets paid rent
  - variable factors are paid their marginal products 

- Ricardo assumed .hi-purple[land is fixed, and has no opportunity cost]
  - Assumes “land” in general, rather than modern assumption: *land for specific uses* (which would have opportunity costs)!
  - That is why the extensive margin of land earns *no rent* (has no alternative use)

- When people use the term “rent” in ordinary language, they mean “contract rent” (what you pay your landlord)
  - this constitutes multiple things: profit, payment for their improvements to land, and pure (Ricardian) rents

- .hi-purple[Ricardian rents] or .hi-purple[Scarcity rents]: Ricardo’s careful definition of rent “the use of the original and indestructible powers of the soil”
  - i.e. permission for using something that already exists (and the landlord did not create)!
  - only exists because of a fixed supply (of land)

- Can apply .hi-purple[Ricardian Rents] to *anything* in scarce supply:
  - talent, intellectual property, monopoly!

  - Rents change to equalize all profits
  - “Rent does not enter into price”
