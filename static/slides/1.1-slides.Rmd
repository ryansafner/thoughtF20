# About This Course

---

# Learning Goals I

1. Understand key economic models of perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, oligopoly (Bertrand, Cournot, and Stackelberg competition), and contestable markets

2. Apply models of competition to different industries and regulatory regimes

3. Simulate strategic and game theoretic interactions and apply them to industry behavior

4. Discuss how firms actually compete with one another

---

# Learning Goals II

<ol start="5">
  <li> Critique textbook models and theories of regulation and antitrust</li>
  <li> Understand the economic problems that firms solve, create, and grapple with</li>
  <li> Debate regulatory solutions to problems and current events in various industries</li>
</ol>
