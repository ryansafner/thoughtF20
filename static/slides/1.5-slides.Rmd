- *The Fable of the Bees* meant to troll moralists

- Society kept in order, division of labor, via government channeling human *vices* not *virtues!* (as moralists supposed)
  - "vices" to Mandeville $\approx$ not living the ascetic life

- Mandeville allegory of society as beehive
  - prospers only when it is full of vice
  - when the hive tries to live virtuous, the system collapses
