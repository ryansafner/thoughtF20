# The Industrial Revolution in Britain: “Engels’ Pause”

> “First, inequality rose substantially in the first four decades of the 19th century. The share of capital income expanded at the expense of both land and labour income. The average real wage stagnated, while the rate of profit doubled. Second, these trends can be explained without reference to contingent events like the Napoleonic Wars or the settlement of the American West...Third...the explanation of growth cannot be separated from the discussion of inequality since each influenced the other. In the first instance, it was the acceleration of productivity growth that led to the rise in inequality. Reciprocally, it was the rising share of profits that induced the savings that met the demand for capital and allowed output to expand.”

> “[W]e can outline the story of the industrial revolution as follows: the prime mover was technical progress beginning with the famous inventions of the 18th century including mechanical spinning, coke smelting, iron puddling, and the steam engine. It was only after 1800 that the revolutionized industries were large enough to affect the national economy. Their impact was reinforced by a supporting boost from rising agricultural productivity and further inventions like the power loom, the railroad, and the application of steam power more generally...The adoption of these inventions led to a rise in demand for capital – for cities, housing, and infrastructure as well as for plant and equipment. Consequently, the rate of return rose and pushed up the share of profits in national income. With more income, capitalists saved more, but the response was limited, the capital–labour ratio rose only modestly, the urban enviro ment suffered as cities were built on the cheap, and the purchasing power of wages stagnated...Real wages rising in line with the growth of labour productivity was not a viable option since income had to shift in favour of property owners in order for their savings to rise enough to allow the economy to take advantage of the new productivity raising methods. Hence, the upward leap in inequality.”

# The Industrial Revolution in Britain: “Engels’ Pause”

> “The rise in inequality, however, had ramifications that made it self-extinguishing. The increase in profits induced enough capital formation by the middle of the 19th century for the economy to realize a balanced growth path with 
capital and augmented labour growing at the same rate. Under this condition, the real wage grew in line with productivity...productivity growth and capital accumulation were principally responsible for the rise in working class living standards after 1850, just as they had been responsible for their stagnation in the first half of the 19th century. Even sustained, rapid population growth was not enough to prevent labour incomes from rising once the accumulation conditions were right.”

- Marx: “capital” defined as indirect, stored-up labor (like Ricardo), resolving all goods into labor-time

- Assumes constant labor/capital ratio across industries (same “capital intensity”)

- Ignores differing fertility of lands in production
  - Apparently by the end of his life he used Ricardian rent theory

- Recall: Smithean .hi[use value vs. exchange value]
  - In primitive society, all production was for immediate consumption (use value), no market exchange

- Marx: price of good resolved into two components:
  - cost of production (i.e. labor-time)
  - .hi-purple[“surplus value”]: difference between price and cost

- Labor is the only source of value, but .hi-purple[workers aren’t paid the full value of the product]!

- .hi-purple[Labor is exploited by capital]; .hi-purple[Proletariat is exploited by Bourgeoisie]

- Capitalist direct production to produce goods for their *exchange value* on the marketplace, in pursuit of profit, rather than for their use value
  - trying to get more exchange value *beyond* mere use value, i.e. profit

- Marxist methodology: because capitalists *own* the means of production (private property, factories, tools, etc) and workers do not, capitalists can control & exploit labor
  - Keep wages low so profits are high

- Using Marx’s methodology, given the current (then and now) modes and relations of production, and the ideological superstructure defending bourgeois capitalism, contradictions must arise

- In his analysis, uses most of the classical (Ricardian) tools and assumptions to analyze:
  - Labor cost theory of value
  - Neutral money
  - Diminishing returns in agriculture
  - Constant returns in manufacturing
  - Perfect competition
  - Rational agents
  - Wages fund doctrine

- Rejected Malthusian population principle, full employment (Say’s Law), and Ricardo’s production function (i.e. homogenous “doses” of L+K)

- Differences vs. Classicals/Ricardo are not in analysis, only in ideology!

- Rejects Malthusian population principle
  - But it explains why, with economic growth (capital accumulation), wages don’t squeeze profits to zero (population increases, depressing real wages to subsistence)

- Marx needs to explain existence of surplus value & profits under capital accumulation and rising wages
  - Solution: .hi-purple[“reserve army of the unemployed”], an excess supply *always* exists in labor markets!
  - This depresses wages, keeping surplus value & profits positive
  - Machines replacing labor (wage increases cause capitalists to substitute cheaper capital for labor)

- Smith, Ricardo, Mill: in long run, profit declines from more competition

- Marx: With capital accumulation, and rising wages, capitalists substitute machinery for labor, further increasing supply of capital and pushing down profits

- Problem — two opposing forces affect rate of profits:
  - capital subject to diminishing returns, increases in capital lower profits
  - technological improvement increases profits
  - so an *empirical* question: compare rate of capital accumulation with rate of technological improvement

- Recognized that occasional depressions happen under capitalism

- Overproduction, violations of Say’s Law

- But Marx had no *theory* of the business cycle (why it happens and what causes it)

- Hypothesized that sudden bursts of technological change could generate a depression
  - increase capital accumulation $\rightarrow$ increased wages & smaller reserve army $\rightarrow$ fall of profit and surplus value $\rightarrow$ spiral into depression
  - but this creates opportunity for expansion: unemployed labor $\rightarrow$ lowers wages $\rightarrow$ restores profits & production again

- With greater capital accumulation, firms will grow larger and fewer, more centralized command of capital, leading to monopolies

> “The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities depends, ceteris paribus, on the productiveness of labor, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller.”

- Lenin and later socialists will argue that monopoly/corporate capitalism is the transition stage to socialism:
  - just replace “managers” with government, “shareholders” with society; run the economy as a giant corporation!

- Several interpretations:
  1. absolute income to Proletariat decreases as capitalism grows
  2. *relative* income (“labor’s share”) to Proletariat decreases as capitalism grows
  3. workers become miserable in a noneconomic, nonmaterial sense (spiritual sense?)

- 1 and 2 were proved flat wrong: increasing prosperity after industrial revolution, labor’s share of income is *remarkably* constant over time (~65-75%)

- Marx’s “laws of capitalism” explain only that there *are* contradictions, does not provide a theory to explain or predict depressions, monopolies, or unemployment; or how to solve them

- So what comes next (socialism), and how does it work? 

- In Marxian methodology: socialism is *defined as* merely the negation of capitalism
  - the antithesis to the thesis, that yields a synthesis
  - instead of bourgeois capitalists privately owning the means of production, they are seized by the Proletariat (through the State)
  - Marx spent little to no time on explaining how socialism ought to work, only wrote that it’s better! 🤷
