# The Industrial Revolution in Britain: “Engels’ Pause”

> “First, inequality rose substantially in the first four decades of the 19th century. The share of capital income expanded at the expense of both land and labour income. The average real wage stagnated, while the rate of profit doubled. Second, these trends can be explained without reference to contingent events like the Napoleonic Wars or the settlement of the American West...Third...the explanation of growth cannot be separated from the discussion of inequality since each influenced the other. In the first instance, it was the acceleration of productivity growth that led to the rise in inequality. Reciprocally, it was the rising share of profits that induced the savings that met the demand for capital and allowed output to expand.”

> “[W]e can outline the story of the industrial revolution as follows: the prime mover was technical progress beginning with the famous inventions of the 18th century including mechanical spinning, coke smelting, iron puddling, and the steam engine. It was only after 1800 that the revolutionized industries were large enough to affect the national economy. Their impact was reinforced by a supporting boost from rising agricultural productivity and further inventions like the power loom, the railroad, and the application of steam power more generally...The adoption of these inventions led to a rise in demand for capital – for cities, housing, and infrastructure as well as for plant and equipment. Consequently, the rate of return rose and pushed up the share of profits in national income. With more income, capitalists saved more, but the response was limited, the capital–labour ratio rose only modestly, the urban enviro ment suffered as cities were built on the cheap, and the purchasing power of wages stagnated...Real wages rising in line with the growth of labour productivity was not a viable option since income had to shift in favour of property owners in order for their savings to rise enough to allow the economy to take advantage of the new productivity raising methods. Hence, the upward leap in inequality.”

# The Industrial Revolution in Britain: “Engels’ Pause”

> “The rise in inequality, however, had ramifications that made it self-extinguishing. The increase in profits induced enough capital formation by the middle of the 19th century for the economy to realize a balanced growth path with 
capital and augmented labour growing at the same rate. Under this condition, the real wage grew in line with productivity...productivity growth and capital accumulation were principally responsible for the rise in working class living standards after 1850, just as they had been responsible for their stagnation in the first half of the 19th century. Even sustained, rapid population growth was not enough to prevent labour incomes from rising once the accumulation conditions were right.”
