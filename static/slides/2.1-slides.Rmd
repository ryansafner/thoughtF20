- Critiques (without naming) Hume’s mere ‘mechanical’ version of sympathy as a mere transfer of emotion
  - seeing another person angry does not make us angry (unless we learn of what prompted the anger)

- Only once we place ourselves in their shoes can we sympathize with their emotion

- We can judge whether another’s emotion was *warranted* by the stimulus
  - the .hi-purple[propriety] or .hi-purple[impropriety] of others’ actions

- The easiest person to fool is *yourself*

> “This self-deceit, this fatal weakness of mankind, is the source of half the disorders of human life. If we saw ourselves in the light in which others see us, or in which they would see us if they knew all, a reformation would generally be unavoidable. We could not otherwise endure the sight.”

- We internalize propriety via the .hi[impartial spectator]

> “It is from him only that we learn the real littleness of ourselves, and of whatever relates to ourselves, and the natural misrepresentations of self-love can be corrected only by the eye of this .hi[impartial spectator]. It is he who shows us the propriety of generosity and the deformity of injustice; the propriety of resigning the greatest interests of our own, for the yet greater interests of others...”

> “We frequently see the respectful attentions of the world more strongly directed towards the rich and great, than towards the wise and virtuous.”

There seems to be one way to continue in that virtuous resolution....hi[Never enter the place from whence so few have been able to return; never come within the circle of ambition]; nor ever bring yourself into comparison with those masters of the earth who have already engrossed the attention of half mankind before you.”

It is then, in the last dregs of life, his body wasted with toil and diseases, his mind galled and ruffled by the memory of a thousand injuries and disappointments which he imagines he has met with from the injustice of his enemies, or from the perfidy and ingratitude of his friends, that he begins at last to find that wealth and greatness are mere trinkets of frivolous utility, no more adapted for procuring ease of body or tranquility of mind than the tweezer-cases of the lover of toys; and like them too, more troublesome to the person who carries them about with him than all the advantages they can afford him are commodious.”

He does not consider that...in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might chuse to impress upon it...If they are opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder,” (Book IV, Ch. II)
