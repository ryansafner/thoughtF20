- The breadth and influence of Smith's *Wealth of Nations (WON)* is incredible
  - theory + history + analogies + policy recommendations
  - borrows concepts from others, but unique in systematization, style, &amp; vision
  
- Everyone should read Smith, those with an interest in economics should read all the Smith you can get your hands on
  - readable, entertaining, insightful, even when he's wrong

&gt; “Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium. Both suppositions are false. A trade which is forced by means of bounties and monopolies may be and commonly is disadvantageous to the country in whose favour it is meant to be established, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter.  But that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on between any two places is always advantageous, though not always equally so, to both.”

&gt; "In order to understand [the kings’ grant of independence to the towns], it must be remembered, that in those days the sovereign of perhaps no country in Europe, was able to protect, through the whole extent of his dominions, the weaker part of his subjects from the oppression of the great lords.

&gt; "The inhabitants of cities and burghs, considered assingle individuals, had no power to defend themselves: but by entering into a league of mutual defence with their neighbours, they were capable of making no contemptible resistance."

&gt; “The lords despised the burghers [townspeople]..The wealth of the burghers never failed to provoke their envy and indignation, and [the lords] plundered them upon every occasion without mercy or remorse. The burghers naturally hated and feared the lords. The king hated and feared them too; but though perhaps he might despise, he had no reason either to hate or fear the burgher.”

&gt; “Mutual interest, therefore, disposed [the burghers] to support the king, and the king to support them against the lords. They were the enemies of his enemies, and it was his interest to render them as secure and independent of those enemies as he could. By granting them magistrates of their own, the privilege of making bye-laws for their own government, that of building walls for their own defence, and that of reducing all their inhabitants under a sort of military discipline, he gave them all the means of security and independency of the barons which it was in his power to bestow. Without the establishment of some regular government of this kind, without some authority to compel their inhabitants to act according to some certain plan or system, no voluntary league of mutual defence could either have afforded them any permanent security, or have enabled them to give the king any considerable support.”

&gt; "In countries such as France or England, where the authority of the sovereign, though frequently very low, never was destroyed altogether, the cities had no opportunity of becoming entirely independent. They became, however, so considerable that the sovereign could impose no tax upon them, besides the stated farm-rent of the town, without their own consent. They were, therefore, called upon to send deputies to the general assembly of the states of the kingdom, where they might join with the clergy and the barons in granting, upon urgent occasions, some extraordinary aid to the king. Being generally, too, more favourable to his power, their deputies seem, sometimes, to have been employed by him as a counter-balance in those assemblies to the authority of the great lords. Hence the origin of the representation of burghs in the states-general of all the great monarchies in Europe."

- Three players:
  1. king
  2. noblity (lords)
  3. towns

- Nobles control vast manors and estates in the countryside

- Towns are full of freemen (with no lords), grow wealthy from trade

- Lords hate towns, towns hate lords

- King and towns find a mutually-beneficial exchange against common enemy: the lords:
  - King exempts towns from feudal ties to lords (effectively grants independence)
  - Allows towns to govern themselves, and pledges mutual protection against lords, in exchange for regular taxes to the King

- Towns choose governance that benefits themselves: stronger property rights, rule of law, justice, military defense against lords
  - Don't get too excited: they are a clear oligarchy, not a democracy!

- King gained increased fiscal capacity (regular tax revenue from towns) and military capacity to weaken the lords

- a lot more wealth, people start buying their way out of feudal dues
  - "bastard feudalism"

- Merchants and townspeople have enough wealth and power to have a seat at the table

- King requires consent of Parliaments, not just of landowning Lords, but also of towns and merchants
