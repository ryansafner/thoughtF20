- The breadth and influence of Smith's *Wealth of Nations (WON)* is incredible
  - theory + history + analogies + policy recommendations
  - borrows concepts from others, but unique in systematization, style, &amp; vision
  
- Everyone should read Smith, those with an interest in economics should read all the Smith you can get your hands on
  - readable, entertaining, insightful

  - against class &amp; privilege (remnants of feudal tyranny)
  - A society of “contract” rather than a society of “status”

- “Liberal” in U.S. politics today is correlated with, but quite different from, “classical liberalism” 
  - U.S. left-wing politics today: 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century Progressivism + some elements of socialism

&gt; As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can ... to employ his capital [in] that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry ... and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention...By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it., (Book IV, Chapter 2: Of restraints upon the importation from foreign countries of such goods as can be produced at home).

&gt; Nothing, however, can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade, upon which, not only these restraints, but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded. When two places trade with one another, this doctrine supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium. Both suppositions are false. A trade which is forced by means of bounties and monopolies may be and commonly is disadvantageous to the country in whose favour it is meant to be established, as I shall endeavour to show hereafter.  But that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally and regularly carried on between any two places is always advantageous, though not always equally so, to both., (Book IV, Chapter 3: Of the extraordinary Restraints upon the Importation of Goods of almost all Kinds, from those Countries with which the Balance is supposed to be Disadvantageous, Part II).

&gt; [A]ccording to the theory of the balance of trade, France has a quite simple means of doubling her capital at any moment.  It suffices merely to pass its products through the customhouse, and then throw them into the sea.  In that case the exports will equal the amount of her capital; imports will be nonexistent and even impossible, and we shall gain all that the ocean has swallowed up, ([The Balance of Trade](http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss13.html\#Chapter 13l) 1848).

&gt; The truth is we should reverse the principle ... and calculate the national profit from foreign trade in terms of the excess of imports over exports...But this theory, which is the correct one, leads directly to the principle of free trade...Assume, if it amuses you, that foreigners flood our shores with all kinds of useful goods, without asking anything from us; even if our imports are *infinite* and our exports *nothing*, I defy you to prove to me that we should be the poorer for it., ([The Balance of Trade](http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basEss13.html\#Chapter 13l) 1848).

&gt; Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. The maxim is so perfectly self-evident that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it. But in the mercantile system the interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce., (Book IV, Chapter 9: Conclusion of the Mercantile system).

&gt; It cannot be very difficult to determine who have been the contrivers of this whole mercantile system; not the consumers, we may believe, whose interest has been entirely neglected; but the producers, whose interest has been so carefully attended to; and among this latter class our merchants and manufacturers have been by far the principal architects, (Book IV, Chapter 9: Conclusion of the Mercantile system).

&gt; We are suffering from the ruinous competition of a foreign rival who apparently works under conditions far superior to our own for the production of light that he is *flooding* the *domestic market* with it at an incredibly low price; for the moment he appears, our sales cease, all the consumers turn to him, and a branch of French industry whose ramifications are innumerable is all at once reduced to complete stagnation., ([The Candlemakers Petition](http://bastiat.org/en/petition.html) 1845).

&gt; [This will] encourage industry and increase employment...If you grant us a monopoly over the production of lighting during the day...we shall buy large amounts of tallow, charcoal, oil, resin, wax...and moreover, we and our numerous suppliers, having become rich, will consume a great deal and spread prosperity into all areas of domestic industry., ([The Candlemakers Petition](http://bastiat.org/en/petition.html) 1845).

&gt; Of all those expensive and uncertain projects, however, which bring bankruptcy upon the greater part of the people who engage in them, there is none perhaps more ruinous than the search after new silver and gold mines. It is perhaps the most disadvantageous lottery in the world, or the one in which the gain of those who draw the prizes bears the least proportion to the loss of those who draw the blanks: for though the prizes are few and the blanks many, the common price of a ticket is the whole fortune of a very rich man, (Book IV, Chapter VII, Part I: Of the Motives for establishing new Colonies)

&gt; To prohibit a great people, however, from making all that they can of every part of their own produce...is a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind. Unjust, however, as such prohibitions may be, they have not hitherto been very hurtful to the colonies..

&gt; We must carefully distinguish between the effects of the colony trade and those of the monopoly of that trade. The former are always and necessarily beneficial; the latter always and necessarily hurtful. But the former are so beneficial that the colony trade, though subject to a monopoly, and notwithstanding the hurtful effects of that monopoly, is still upon the whole beneficial, and greatly beneficial; though a good deal less so than it otherwise would be...Under the present system of management, therefore, Great Britain derives nothing but loss from the dominion which she assumes over her colonies., (Book IV, Chapter VII, Part II: Causes of Prosperity of new Colonies)

- Humans are self-interested by nature, guided by their own needs

&gt; “To man is allotted a much humbler department, but one much more suitable to the weakness of his powers, and to the narrowness of his comprehension: the care of his own happiness, of that of his family, his friends, his country...But though we are...endowed with a very strong desire of those ends, it has been entrusted to the slow and uncertain determinations of our reason to find out the proper means of bringing them about. Nature has directed us to the greater part of these by original and immediate instincts. Hunger, thirst, the passion which unites the two sexes, and the dread of pain, prompt us to apply those means for their own sakes, and without any consideration of their tendency to those beneficent ends which the great Director of nature intended to produce by them.”
