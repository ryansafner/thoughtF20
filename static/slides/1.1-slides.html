All this is, of course, in addition to familiarity with the economic literature itself...[The person best suited to economics is] the outstanding intellectual all-rounder with some leaning towards the arts rather than the natural science side.‚Äù

&gt; The RCT is a useful tool, but I think that is a mistake to put method ahead of substance. I have written papers using RCTs...[but] no RCT can ever legitimately claim to have established causality. My theme is that RCTs have no special status, they have no exemption from the problems of inference that econometricians have always wrestled with, and there is nothing that they, and only they, can accomplish.

&gt; ‚ÄúPeople keep saying that the recent Nobelists "studied global poverty." This is exactly wrong. They made a commitment to a method, not a subject, and their commitment to method prevented them from studying global poverty.‚Äù

Cancer we have some ideas how to treat it but there are a variety of approaches and since we cannot be sure and precise about which is best for you, we will ignore the cancer and not treat it.‚Äù

# Some Sociology of the Economics Profession

&gt; "Each year, almost every economics Ph.D. program produces more Ph.D.s than it can hire. As a result, candidates from the top departments trickle down, filling openings at lower-ranked departments, crowding most of the graduates of those departments to jobs in departments further down the rankings...the vast majority of new economics Ph.D.s ... moved to jobs in departments at least 50 ranks below their graduate department..." p. 7

# Some Sociology of the Economics Profession

&gt; "[T]here is a strong demand in numerous sectors for new economics Ph.D.s, and almost everyone lands a job that they like. In a survey of economics job candidates from 2007 to 2010, job candidates received on average 16.8 interviews at the ASSA meetings, 5.7 flyouts, and 2.9 job offers (McFall et al., 2015). By the end of summer, 92% of job candidates had accepted a job...only 6% received no job offers....64% of job candidates got their top choice of sector (among: four-year college, university, nonprofit/government, business/industry, and postdoc). Another 20% got their second choice, and only 7% placed into jobs they had ranked fourth or fifth out of the five types. In addition, more than two-thirds of respondents (69.1%) were either ‚Äúvery satisfied‚Äù or ‚Äúextremely satisfied‚Äù with their placements...‚Äù"

"[S]ince the year 2000,the real (inflation-adjusted) salaries of new assistant professors of economics in Ph.D.-granting institutions have risen over 36%. In 2017-18, the salary offered to new assistant professors of economics by Ph.D.-granting institutions averaged $132,143 (Scott and Siegfried, 2018). Finally, National Science Foundation data indicate that Ph.D. economists have the lowest unemployment rate (0.9%) of any doctoral field, as well as one of the highest median salaries of any doctoral field." pp.7-8

"Table 1 provides...a measure of the intellectual diversity in some top programs [using] the ratio of the number of different programs from which professors come to the total number of professors in the department. The higher the dispersion index number the wider the gene pool of graduates of that program. 

Thus, if there were 10 professors at a program, and they came from 10 different programs, the dispersion index would be 1. If, however, they all came from the same school, the dispersion index would be 0.1.

MIT and Harvard have...the smallest gene pool of the programs listed. Chicago has the largest, which is still only 0.5...professors at these top programs come from a relatively small group of programs, [and] the most inbreeding occurs at MIT and Harvard and the least at Chicago." (p.157)

# Mainstream vs. Mainline Economics

&gt; "We understand .hi[mainline economists] to work in the .hi[tradition of Adam Smith]. They start with the postulate that shortsighted, cognitively limited /hi[individuals pursue their own self-interest]. They focus their scholarly efforts on studying how these individuals, acting in their own self-interest, .hi[create complex social arrangements] under the .hi[division of labor] that .hi[align individual interest with the social interest]. Thus, they tend to rely on invisible-hand theorizing to analyze how individuals coordinate individual plans in an .hi[orderly decentralized fashion]...Accordingly, mainline economists, tend to view economics primarily as the .hi[science of exchange]." (p.1220)

# Mainstream vs. Mainline Economics

&gt; In contrast, we understand .hi[mainstream economists] to tend to .hi[follow the scientific trends of their days] and, at times, to be taken far afield from the mainline of economics by the pursuit of current fashions...[We have argued that] in the 1930s, mainstream economics moved away from the advancement of the propositions explored by mainline economists. Instead of viewing economics primarily as the science of exchange, economics became a .hi[science of choice]...modeling the choice of .hi[cognitively perfect individuals in ideal situations], leaving no room for institutional analysis and operative mechanisms to explain how markest work given behavioral deviations from the hypothesized ideal man...opening the door to the use of .hi[economics as a tool of social control]..." (pp.1220-1221).

&gt; "Nobel Laureates working in the mainline of economics have had a more enduring impact on the social science profession than those working in the mainstream of economics.

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

- Identify key economic writers and their contributions to economic thought
- Discuss the influence and value of different writers and their contributions
- Identify and distinguish the major schools of economic thought: Classical, Marxist, Neoclassical, Austrian, Keynesian, Monetarist, New Classical
- Place theories and ideas studied within the context of the time
- Better comprehend the origins and context of orthodox economic theory today
- Explore critiques of orthodox economic theory from various heterodox schools of thought and understand contested areas
- Reflect on the nature of economics as a discipline
- Understand the origins of key economic concepts and models
- Trace the evolution of major ideas through time, via your own writing
