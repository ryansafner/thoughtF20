- What role do costs of production (payments to factors) play in value of final goods?

- Costs are the values which are forgone in directing resources to a particular production process rather than other production processes

- In this sense, production costs are really a reflection of utilities elsewhere in the economy

- Beginnings of major disagreements:

- Jevons always thought costs were “real” in some sense, e.g. the *disutility* or pain of labor
  - utility of consumption vs. disutility of production; utility & disutility curves

- Marshall & Edgeworth would later argue you can derive an upward-sloping supply/cost curve for non-land factors by disutility of use

- If we all agree that prices of final goods reflect their marginal utility, how do we price factor services (land, labor, capital)?

- Wieser’s solution was .hi-purple[linear programming] with simultaneous equations (no calculus)

- .hi-green[Example]: consider a three-good society, factors in each good’s production are $x$, $y$, and $z$, represented by three simultaneous equations:

$$\begin{align*}
x+y&=100\\
2x+3z&=290\\
4y+5z&=590\\
\end{align*}$$

- Solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$ (prices of each factor)

- Assumes prices for final goods are given, fixed production coefficients, and no substitution of factors

> “If in any branch of production the price sinks below the cost...men will withdraw from that branch and engage in some better paying branch of production. Conversely, if in one branch of production, the market price of the finished good is considerably higher than the value of the sacrificed or expended means of production, then will men be drawn from less profitable industries. They will press into the better paying branch of production, until through the increased supply, the price is again forced down to cost.

> “What determine the amount of this cost? .hi[The amount of the cost] is identical with the value of the productive power, and, as a rule, is determined by the money marginal utility of this productive power...The price of a definite specie of freely reproducible goods fixes itself in the long run at that point where the money marginal utility, for those who desire to purchase these products, .hi[intersects the money marginal utility of all those who desire to purchase in the other communicating branches of production.] The figure of the two blade of a pair of shears still holds good. One of the two blade, whose coming together determine the height of the price of any species of product, is in truth the marginal utility of this particular product. The other, which we are wont to call .hi["cost," is the marginal utility of the products of other communicating branches of production.] Or, according to Wieser, the marginal utility of "production related goods." .hi[It is, therefore, utility and not disutility which, as well on the side of supply as of demand, determine the height of the price.] This, too, even where the so-called law of cost plays its role in giving value to goods. .hi[Jevons, therefore, did not exaggerate the importance of the one side, but came very near the truth when he said "value depends entirely upon utility.”] (45)

- Uses Euler’s Theorem of homogeneous functions to **prove** product exhaustion under specific conditions:
  - production functions must be linearly homogenous (of degree 1)
  - $c^{n}Y =f(c^{n}L,c^{n}K,c^{n}T)$ only for $n=1$
  - we would say: .hi-purple[“constant returns to scale”]
  
- Criticized for this by many (Edgeworth, Pareto, Wicksell, etc.)
  - John Hicks: “Where Wicksteed went wrong was his assumption that he could argue from the shape of the curve at one particular point to the general shape of the curve.”

# Returns to Scale

- The .hi[returns to scale] of production refers to the change in output when all inputs are increased *at the same rate*

--

- .hi-purple[Constant returns to scale]: output increases at same proportionate rate as inputs increase
    - e.g. if you double all inputs, output doubles

--

- .hi-purple[Increasing returns to scale]: output increases *more than* proportionately to the change in inputs
    - e.g. if you double all inputs, output *more than* doubles

--

- .hi-purple[Decreasing returns to scale]: output increases *less than* proportionately to the change in inputs
    - e.g. if you double all inputs, output *less than* doubles

- Think about what you learn in microeconomics

- In perfect competition, in the long run, as profits attract entrants and losses force exits, price settles on the break-even point, where profit is 0
  - $p=MC=AC_{min}$
  - factors are paid their opportunity costs (marginal products); nothing leftover

"Two men jointly lift heavy cargo into trucks. Solely by observing the total marginal productivity and making pay-weight loaded per day, it is impossible to determine each person's marginal productivity...In team production, marginal products of cooperative team members are not so directly and separably (i.e., cheaply) observable. What a team offers to the market can be taken as the marginal product of the team but not of the team members. .hi[The costs of metering or ascertaining the marginal products of the team's members is what calls forth new organizations and procedures]," (pp.778).

- Factor employment is determined by supply & demand of factor, where demand is driven by the factor’s marginal revenue product
  - if market price is above equilibrium (e.g. $w_2)$, a surplus (unemployment) of that factor

- Prices will adjust downwards to equilibrium

- What implications does this have for macroeconomic policy?

- Applied to the entire economy, implies that (non-frictional) unemployment is due to above-equilibrium factor prices
  - markets will correct this by adjusting prices downwards

- Anticipating Keynes:
  - but is it that easy to lower wages??
  - if workers have less income, will that affect aggregate demand?

- MPT describes the outcome to which we are always *approaching* (i.e. perfect competition), it is an equilibrium state of rest
  - *actual* prices in real world are not equilibrium prices, we are not in perfect competition

- In *long run equilibrium* in *perfect competition*, factor prices are paid their marginal products
  - $p = MC$, all factors are paid opportunity costs, firms break even and “exhaust the product” $AR(q)=AC(q)$

- A scarce factor (talent, etc) will command higher prices (and reap economic rents), might be efficient, but is that *moral*?
