- What role do costs of production (payments to factors) play in value of final goods?

- Costs are the values which are forgone in directing resources to a particular production process rather than other production processes

- In this sense, production costs are really a reflection of utilities elsewhere in the economy

- Beginnings of major disagreements:

- Jevons always thought costs were “real” in some sense, e.g. the *disutility* or pain of labor
  - utility of consumption vs. disutility of production; utility & disutility curves

- Marshall & Edgeworth would later argue you can derive an upward-sloping supply/cost curve for non-land factors by disutility of use

- Menger had clear insights about capital and production: goods of higher order, their complementarity and substitutability, etc.

- If we all agree that prices of final goods reflect their marginal utility, how do we price factor services (land, labor, capital)?

- Wieser’s solution was .hi-purple[linear programming] with simultaneous equations (no calculus)

- .hi-green[Example]: consider a three-good society, factors in each good’s production are $x$, $y$, and $z$, represented by three simultaneous equations:

$$\begin{align*}
x+y&=\$100\\
2x+3z&=\$290\\
4y+5z&=\$590\\ \end{align*}$$

- Solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$ (prices of each factor)

- Assumes prices for final goods are given, fixed production coefficients, and no substitution of factors

- Took a different approach to the imputation problem (factor pricing) than Wieser:

- Followed a phrase in Menger, “the loss principle” — applying to the price of the final good what would be lost if one of the factor services is withdrawn

- Ricardo’s theory of rent applied marginal analysis (“doses” of L+K) to a fixed factor (land), concluding the fixed factor earns a residual surplus (gap between AP>MP) of variable factor (L+K)

# Marginal Productivity Theory

  - .hi-purple[“Law of variable proportions” or “variation of returns”]

- For *any* one variable factor (holding all others constant), increasing use will eventually yield a diminishing marginal product

- Think about what you learn in microeconomics

- In perfect competition, in the long run, as profits attract entrants and losses force exits, price settles on the break-even point, where profit is 0
  - $p=MC=AC_{min}$
