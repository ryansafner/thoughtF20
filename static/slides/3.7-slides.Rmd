> “This book shows clear signs of genius, and is a promise of great things to come...His readers may sometimes wish that he had kept his work by him a little longer till he had worked it out a little more fully, and obtained that simplicity which comes only through long labour. But taking it as what it claims to be, ‘a tentative study’, we can only admire its brilliancy, force, and originality.” — Marshall

> “Whatever else readers of this book may think about it, they would probably all agree that it is a very remarkable one...There can be no doubt that in the style of his composition Mr. Edgeworth does not do justice to his matter. His style, if not obscure, is implicit, so that the reader is left to puzzle out every important sentence like an enigma” — Jevons

> “Is [economic competition] peace or war? ... It is both, *pax* or *pact* between contractors during contract, *war*, when some of the contractors *without the consent of others recontract*. Thus, an auctioneer having been in contact with the last bidder (to sell at such a price *if* no higher bid) *recontracts* with a higher bidder. So a landlord on expiry of lease recontracts, it may be, with a new tenant. The *field of competition* with reference to a contract, or contracts, under consideration consists of all the individuals who are willing and able to recontract about the articles under consideration. Thus, in an auction the field consists of the auctioneer and all who are effectively willing to give a higher price than the last bid. In this case, as the transaction reaches determination, the field continually diminishes and ultimately vanishes. But this is not the case in general.” (p.485 in *Reader*).

> “A *settlement* is a contract which cannot be varied with the consent of all the parties to it. A *final settlement* is a settlement which cannot be varied by recontract, within the field of competition. Contract is *indeterminate* when there are an indefinite number of *final settlements*,” (p.485 in *Reader*)

# Influence and Controversy

.quitesmall[
> “One of Pareto’s equations achieved special prominence, and controversy. He was fascinated by problems of power and wealth. How do people get it? How is it distributed around society? How do those who have it use it? The gulf between rich and poor has always been part of the human condition, but Pareto resolved to measure it. He gathered reams of data on wealth and income through different centuries, through different countries: the tax records of Basel, Switzerland, from 1454 and from Augsburg, Germany, in 1471, 1498 and 1512; contemporary rental income from Paris; personal income from Britain, Prussia, Saxony, Ireland, Italy, Peru. What he found – or thought he found – was striking. When he plotted the data on graph paper, with income on one axis, and number of people with that income on the other, he saw the same picture nearly everywhere in every era. Society was not a ‘social pyramid’ with the proportion of rich to poor sloping gently from one class to the next. Instead it was more of a ‘social arrow’ – very fat on the bottom where the mass of men live, and very thin at the top where sit the wealthy elite. Nor was this effect by chance; the data did not remotely fit a bell curve, as one would expect if wealth were distributed randomly. ‘It is a social law’, he wrote: something ‘in the nature of man.’ At the bottom of the Wealth curve, he wrote, Men and Women starve and children die young. In the broad middle of the curve all is turmoil and motion: people rising and falling, climbing by talent or luck and falling by alcoholism, tuberculosis and other kinds of unfitness. At the very top sit the elite of the elite, who control wealth and power for a time – until they are unseated through revolution or upheaval by a new aristocratic class. There is no progress in human history. Democracy is a fraud. Human nature is primitive, emotional, unyielding. The smarter, abler, stronger, and shrewder take the lion's share. The weak starve, lest society become degenerate: One can, Pareto wrote, ‘compare the social body to the human body, which will promptly perish if prevented from eliminating toxins.’ Inflammatory stuff – and it burned Pareto's reputation.”

- Pareto defines an increase in “opelimity” as a move onto a higher indifference curve

> “We will say that the members of a collectivity enjoy a maximum of ophelimity at a certain position when it is impossible to move a small step away such that the ophelimity enjoyed by each individual in the collectivity increases, or such that it diminishes. That is to say that any small step is bound to increase the ophelimity of some individuals while diminishing that of others.”

> “For phenomena of type I [perfect competition], when equilibrium takes place at a point of tangency of indifference curves, the members of the collectivity enjoy a maximum of ophelimity.”

# The Second Fundamental Welfare Theorem

- Recall that the set of possible Pareto efficient outcomes (the contract curve) **depends on the endowments individuals start with**

- If instead of point $E$, we start with endowment at point $J$:
  - .blue[Person 1] has 8 apples, 2 bananas
  - .green[Person 2] has 2 apples, 8 bananas

- Then there is a *different* range of outcomes that are Pareto efficient

> “Consider a collectivist society which seeks to maximise the ophelimity of its members. The problem divides into two parts. Firstly we have a problem of distribution: how should the goods within a society be shared between its members? And secondly, how should production be organised so that, when goods are so distributed, the members of society obtain the maximum ophelimity?”

His answer is an informal precursor of the second welfare theorem:

> “Having distributed goods according to the answer to the first problem, the state should allow the members of the collectivity to operate a second distribution, or operate it itself, in either case making sure that it is performed in conformity with the workings of free competition.”
