- Divided up society in functional terms: land, labor, capital
  - each earns a return: wages, rent, profits

- Roles of capitalist and entrepreneur often were the same person, historically

  - MPT explains all revenues from firm sales ultimately go to factors of production as income (costs to firm)
  - Each factor paid its marginal product, contribution to production

- Marginal product of capital *should* just be the value of the land and labor used to make the capital in the past
  - But capital earns interest!

- Capital makes land & labor *more* productive, maybe interest is that extra productivity?
  - But: MPT implies that labor and land each are already paid *more* from their higher marginal products (due to having the capital)!

- Interest even exists in long-run equilibrium of perfect competition (when profits disappear)

  1. Money is neutral in the long run (no permanent change in $V$ or $Y)$ from $\Delta M$
