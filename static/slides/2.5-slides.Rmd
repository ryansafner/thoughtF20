  1. increased investment in agriculture had *diminishing returns*, and

> “If the interests of the landlord be of sufficient consequence, to determine us not to avail ourselves of all the benefits which would follow from importing corn at a cheap price, they should also influence us in rejecting all improvements in agriculture, and in the implements of husbandry; for it is as certain that corn is rendered cheap, rents are lowered, and the ability of the landlord to pay taxes, is for a time, at least, as much impaired by such improvements, as by the importation of corn. To be consistent then, let us by the same act arrest improvement, and prohibit importation.”

> “To produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labour of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the
same country, might require the labour of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth. This exchange might even take place, notwithstanding that the commodity imported by Portugal could be produced there with less labour than in England. Though she could make the cloth with the labour of 90 men, she would import it from a country where it required the labour of 100 men to produce it, because it would be advantageous to her rather to employ her capital in the production of wine, for which she would obtain more cloth from England, than she could produce by diverting a portion of her capital from the cultivation of vines to the manufacture of cloth.”

> "[Repealing the Corn laws would solve four problems.] First, it would guarantee the prosperity of the manufacturer by affording him outlets for his products. Second, it would relieve the Condition of England question by cheapening the price of food and ensuring more regular employment. Third, it would make English agriculture more efficient by stimulating demand for its products in urban and industrial areas. Fourth, it would introduce through mutually advantageous international trade a new era of international fellowship and peace. The only barrier to these four beneficent solutions was the ignorant self-interest of the landlords, the "bread-taxing oligarchy, unprincipled, unfeeling, rapacious and plundering."

- “Rent” to landowner in everyday language is not precise!
  - Contains both elements of “profits” and “rents” (payment for land improvements)

> “If, then, good land existed in quantity much more abundant than the production of food for an increasing population required, or if capital could be indefinitely employed without a diminished return on the old land, there could be no rise of rent; for rent invariably proceeds from the employment of an additional quantity of labour with a proportionally less return.”

- Example adapted from Blaug (1996)

- Suppose the price of corn is $1 per bushel
  - so marginal physical product = marginal value product (just add a $ in front)

- Price of one homogenous unit of K+L (“man-with-shovel”) is $100

- Assume each farmer (A, B, C) will apply a K+L dose so long as $MR>MC$

- In Ricardian theory, the .hi-purple[fixed factor of production] (land) earns all inframarginal residuals, i.e. gets paid rent
  - variable factors are paid their marginal products 

- Ricardo assumed .hi-purple[land is fixed, and has no opportunity cost]
  - Assumes “land” in general, rather than modern assumption: *land for specific uses* (which would have opportunity costs)!
  - That is why the extensive margin of land earns *no rent* (has no alternative use)
