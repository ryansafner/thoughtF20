- Son of James Mill

- One of the most important writers in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in general
  - philosophy, logic, ethics, social reforms, politics, and economics

- A very careful and deliberate thinker

- Politics are a blend of classical liberal, philosophical radical, utilitarian, sympathetic to (pre-Marxian) socialism

- *Autobiography*
  - insane private education under father James Mill (groomed J.S. to be the new prophet of Bentham‚Äôs utilitarianism)
  - disillusioned with Bentham‚Äôs (version of) utilitarianism (maximize pleasure, minimize pain for society)
  - nervous breakdown at 21

- Broke with Bentham (and James Mill) on utilitarianism
  - Benthamites too dogmatic and certain of their optimal policies; Mill is more open-minded
  - Pleasure-pain calculus is too *hedonistic*, humans are different from animals!
  - much more left-leaning than his father &amp; Bentham
  - writes his own defense of utilitarianism; intent on improving the role of the individual in society

- *An Outline of the Science of Political Economy* (1836)

- Political economy was a deductive science:

.quitesmall[
&gt; ‚Äú[P]remises consist of a very few general propositions...and scarcely requiring proof, or even formal statement, which almost every man, as soon as he hears them, admits as familiar to his thoughts...and his inferences are nearly as general, and, if he has reasoned correctly, as certain, as his premises.‚Äù

- Four self-evident principles of political economy:
  1. Rationality (people attempt to acquire wealth and minimize sacrifice)
  2. Malthusian population principle
  3. Diminishing returns in agriculture
  4. Principle of increasing returns for industry

- Political economy should strictly be a *positive* science, not normative:

- .hi-purple[Abstinence theory]: capital comes from the abstinence of consumption, someone must *save* their income
  - labor is paid due to the disutility of labor
  - capitalists are analogously paid for their patience and the disutility of abstaining from consumption

- Labor &amp; capital are both necessary to production, thus profits are the payment earned by capital
  - Again, classical failure to separate interest from profit

- Competition and custom together govern the distribution of income
  - Classicals only focus on the former, ignore the latter

&gt; ‚ÄúThey are apt to express themselves as if they thought that competition actually does, in all cases, whatever it can be shown to be the tendency of competition to do.‚Äù

- Historically, market societies are young; most of history income was governed by tradition and custom (e.g. feudalism)

- Often believed that Mill was a mere systematizer of Classical thought, but he had some original contributions:
  - theory of non-competing groups and effects on relative wages
  - recognized land has an opportunity cost, rent-less margin in Ricardo is false - rent is a cost in production
  - first focus on economics of the firm, economies of scale
  - treats supply and demand as functions relating price and quantity

&gt; ‚Äú[T]he proper mathematical analogy is that of an equation. Demand and supply, the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied, will be made equal. If unequal at any moment, competition equalizes them, and the manner in which this is done is by an adjustment of the value. If the demand increases, the value rises; if the demand diminishes, the value falls: again, if they supply falls off, the value rises; and falls if the supply is increased.‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúAt such times there is really an excess of all commodities above the money demand: in other words, there is an undersupply of money.

- Wages fund theory (it was he who coined the term)
  - short-run demand of labor fixed by the amount that capitalists can advance to labor
  - increases in real wages have little effect in short run (takes time for population to increase and children to mature into laborers)
  - in long-run, Malthusian population principle dictates population growth depresses real wages to subsistence

- Theory allegedly used to argue against formation of unions (who aim to raise wages)
  - But no evidence classical economists argued against unions, many favored them

- But with decline of pop. principle, how to explain long run wages?

- Mill (famously) changes his mind about wages fund theory by 1869

John Stuart Mill

1806-1873
]
]
.right-column[

- Mill, along with Ricardo and Smith, naturally are skeptical of landlords and their lack of contribution to society

- Because land rent is price-determined, not price-determining (assuming land is fixed and has no opportunity cost), rent to landowners is mere surplus, not affecting production
  - Land does not contribute to production, merely a payment to ‚Äúallow‚Äù production to take place
  - It‚Äôs really just standing space that somebody owns

- This implies that it would make no difference at all if rent goes to the landowners or to the government
  - Would have no effect on production
  - Classicals and their followers advocated tax on land rent for these reasons

Steam and electricity, mechanization, specialization, and new business methods greatly increased the power of labor...Surely, these new powers would elevate society from its foundations, lifting the poorest above worry for the material needs of life...Yet we must now face facts we cannot mistake. All over the world we hear complaints of...labor condemned to involuntary idleness; capital going to waste...Where do we find the deepest poverty, the hardest struggle for existence, the greatest enforced idleness? Why, wherever material progress is most advanced...This relation of poverty to progress is the great question of our time."

# Rent with a Fixed Factor Supply 

.pull-left[

- An increase in demand raises the price of the factor, and creates *more* economic rents

- Think of land during the industrial revolution
  - Lazy landowners earn more income by doing nothing, don‚Äôt need to produce for industry

# A Tax on Land Rent

.pull-left[

- A tax on land, `\(\color{purple}{\tau}\)`, (if supply is perfectly inelastic) would *not be distortionary*!

- Gross price to buyers `\((r_g)\)` remains the same, quantity of land used T*, remains the same!

- No deadweight loss!

- .hi-purple[Landowners bear the full economic incidence of the tax]
