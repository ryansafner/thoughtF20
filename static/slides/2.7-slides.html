- Son of James Mill

- One of the most important writers in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, in general
  - philosophy, logic, ethics, social reforms, politics, and economics

- A very careful and deliberate thinker

- Politics are a blend of classical liberal, philosophical radical, utilitarian, sympathetic to (pre-Marxian) socialism

- *Autobiography*
  - insane private education under father James Mill (groomed J.S. to be the new prophet of Bentham’s utilitarianism)
  - disillusioned with Bentham’s (version of) utilitarianism (maximize pleasure, minimize pain for society)
  - nervous breakdown at 21

- Broke with Bentham (and James Mill) on utilitarianism
  - Benthamites too dogmatic and certain of their optimal policies; Mill is more open-minded
  - Pleasure-pain calculus is too *hedonistic*, humans are different from animals!
  - much more left-leaning than his father &amp; Bentham
  - writes his own defense of utilitarianism; intent on improving the role of the individual in society

- Very classically liberal in general

- But clear roles for government intervention

.quitesmall[
&gt; “it is not admissible that the protection of persons and that of property are the sole purposes of government. The ends of government are as comprehensive as those of the social union. They consist of all the good, and all the immunity from evil, which the existence of government can be made directly or indirectly to bestow”

Nassau Senior

.right-column[

- One of Ricardian economics’ biggest proponents after Ricardo’s death

- *An Outline of the Science of Political Economy* (1836)
  - political economy as “the Nature, the Production, and the Distribution of Wealth”

- Political economy was a deductive science:

.quitesmall[
&gt; “[P]remises consist of a very few general propositions...and scarcely requiring proof, or even formal statement, which almost every man, as soon as he hears them, admits as familiar to his thoughts...and his inferences are nearly as general, and, if he has reasoned correctly, as certain, as his premises.”

Nassau Senior

.right-column[

- Four self-evident principles of political economy:
  1. Rationality (people attempt to acquire wealth and minimize sacrifice)
  2. Malthusian population principle
  3. Diminishing returns in agriculture
  4. Principle of increasing returns for industry

- Political economy should strictly be a *positive* science, not normative:

.quitesmall[

- Cornerstone of Ricardian economics — diminishing returns to agriculture; what about technological improvements?

- An empirical question, not a theoretical conclusion!
  - technological improvements can surpass, equal, or fail to offset diminishing returns

.right-column[

- Senior had an innovative response to critiques of profit theory
  - attempted to separate profit and interest

- .hi-purple[Abstinence theory]: capital comes from the abstinence of consumption, someone must *save* their income
  - labor is paid due to the disutility of labor
  - capitalists are analogously paid for their patience and the disutility of abstaining from consumption

- Labor &amp; capital are both necessary to production, thus profits are the payment earned by capital
  - Again, classical failure to separate interest from profit
  - Faintest beginnings of interest theory in macroeconomics

- If we can attain a more just distribution, then 

&gt; “the principle of individual property would have been found to have no necessary connection with the physical and social evils which almost all Socialist writers assume to be inseparable from it.”

&gt; “Competition is beneficial to society; every restriction of it is an evil, and every extension of it, even if for the time injuriously affecting some classes of labourers, is always an ultimate good.”

- Blend of Smith and Ricardo in his methodology

  - Conclusions and hypotheses are deduced from assumptions *a priori*
  - But then hypotheses must be verified by real world evidence!

- Competition and custom together govern the distribution of income
  - Classicals only focus on the former, ignore the latter

&gt; “They are apt to express themselves as if they thought that competition actually does, in all cases, whatever it can be shown to be the tendency of competition to do.”

- Historically, market societies are young; most of history income was governed by tradition and custom (e.g. feudalism)
  - modern, profit-maximizing businesses are a new thing
  - and yet: 

&gt; “Only through the principle of competition has political economy any pretensions to the character of a science.”

- Often believed that Mill was a mere systematizer of Classical thought, but he had some original contributions:
  - theory of non-competing groups and effects on relative wages
  - recognized land has an opportunity cost, rent-less margin in Ricardo is false - rent is a cost in production
  - first focus on economics of the firm, economies of scale
  - treats supply and demand as functions relating price and quantity
  - nicely treated Say’ Law with money

- Mill did not use these diagrams, but they he explains several cases that we can visualize:

&gt; “[T]he proper mathematical analogy is that of an equation. Demand and supply, the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied, will be made equal. If unequal at any moment, competition equalizes them, and the manner in which this is done is by an adjustment of the value. If the demand increases, the value rises; if the demand diminishes, the value falls: again, if they supply falls off, the value rises; and falls if the supply is increased.”

- Wages fund theory (it was he who coined the term)
  - short-run demand of labor fixed by the amount that capitalists can advance to labor
  - increases in real wages have little effect in short run (takes time for population to increase and children to mature into laborers)
  - in long-run, Malthusian population principle dictates population growth depresses real wages to subsistence

- Theory allegedly used to argue against formation of unions (who aim to raise wages)
  - But no evidence classical economists argued against unions, many favored them

- But with decline of pop. principle, how to explain long run wages?

- Mill (famously) changes his mind about wages fund theory by 1869

John Stuart Mill

1806-1873
]
]
.right-column[

- Mill, along with Ricardo and Smith, naturally are skeptical of landlords and their lack of contribution to society

- Because land rent is price-determined, not price-determining (assuming land is fixed and has no opportunity cost), rent to landowners is mere surplus, not affecting production
  - Land does not contribute to production, merely a payment to “allow” production to take place
  - It’s really just standing space that somebody owns

- This implies that it would make no difference at all if rent goes to the landowners or to the government
  - Would have no effect on production
  - Classicals and their followers advocated tax on land rent for these reasons

All over the world we hear complaints of...labor condemned to involuntary idleness; capital going to waste...Where do we find the deepest poverty, the hardest struggle for existence, the greatest enforced idleness? Why, wherever material progress is most advanced...This relation of poverty to progress is the great question of our time."

# A Tax on Land Rent

.pull-left[

- A tax on land, `\(\color{purple}{\tau}\)`, (if supply is perfectly inelastic) would *not be distortionary*!

- Gross price to buyers `\((r_g)\)` remains the same, quantity of land used T*, remains the same!

- No deadweight loss!

- .hi-purple[Landowners bear the full economic incidence of the tax]
