We must suppress them in order to free humanity from wage slavery,their resistance must be crushed by force; it is clear that there is no freedom and no democracy where there is suppression and where there is violence," (pp.62-65).

&gt; “Consider a collectivist society which seeks to maximise the ophelimity of its members. The problem divides into two parts. Firstly we have a problem of distribution: how should the goods within a society be shared between its members? And secondly, how should production be organised so that, when goods are so distributed, the members of society obtain the maximum ophelimity?”

His answer is an informal precursor of the second welfare theorem:

&gt; “Having distributed goods according to the answer to the first problem, the state should allow the members of the collectivity to operate a second distribution, or operate it itself, in either case making sure that it is performed in conformity with the workings of free competition.”

&gt; "[It was Mises'] powerful challenge that forced the socialists to recognize the importance of an adequate system of economic accounting to guide the allocation of resources in a socialist economy. Even more, it was chiefly due to Professor Mises' challenge that many socialists became aware of the very existence of such a problem," (p.53).

&gt; "Professor Mises' contention that a socialist economy cannot solve the problem of rational allocation of resources is based on a confusion concerning the nature of prices...[Prices are merely trade-off ratios, the] terms on which alternatives are offered," (p.54).

The administrators of a socialist economy will have exactly the same knowledge, or lack of knowledge, of the production functions as the capitalist entrepreneurs have.," (p.55).

# The Socialist Calculation Debate In Retrospect II

Stages of the debate:

1. Marxists argue for moneyless, propertyless, centrally-planned economy as a superior system for achieving coordinated, "advanced material production" as compared to the ``anarchy'' of capitalist production
2. Mises (1920) argued that socialism cannot achieve its defined goals due to its inability to solve the economic calculation problem
3. Developments in NC-GE theory show logical/formal similarity of systems of equations between the socialist and capitalist system under static, ideal, conditions
4. Hayek extends Mises' calculation point as a problem of dispersed tacit knowledge (impossible to achieve via equation-solving) that is not *given* to any agent or system; competition and market prices enable *discovery* of optimal resource uses 
5. Lange &amp; others argue "market socialism" can approximate *perfect competition*
