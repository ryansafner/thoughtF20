- Son of Auguste Walras, an economics teacher &amp; friends with Cournot

- Leon came up with his own theory of marginalism in 1870s

- A very quarrelsome man, became very bitter against British economists
  - famously accuses Wicksteed of plagiarism
  - grudge against Edgeworth for not publishing his review in *EJ*

- Could not get a university job in his home country (France), became professor at Lausanne (Switzerland)
  - considered the founder of the “Lausanne School” of economics (with Pareto as his greatest student)

- But he was widely read and recognized

- Walras praised the virtues of free competition, but against the problem of monopoly and landlords (an even bigger problem in France than Britain)

- Walras suggested a sort of “synthetic socialism” on essentially Georgist lines
  - Government should own the land, people rent land from government, and government distributes the rents to society as a “social dividend”, essentially a basic income

- But was opposed to government management and central planning (for fear the government would become the new feudal landlords)

- Followed Cournot: can demonstrate that prices can adjust to clear a *single* market `\((Q_d=Q_s)\)`; does an equilibrium set of prices exist that clear *all markets simultaneously?*
  - This has been the lure of .hi[general equilibrium] for decades

- Walras’ math was quite crude (he failed to get into the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique because he failed the math exam)

- But he sketched the outline of the problem, suggested how to find solutions, and elucidated many flaws that would take decades to understand &amp; correct
  - Finally rigorously proved in 1950s!

# General Equilibrium, A Motivation

.quitesmall[
&gt; “We have shown that consumers with given money incomes maximize utility relative to prices ruling in the market so as to obtain the same marginal utility per dollar from every product they purchase. At the same time, producers maximize profits relative to factor and product prices by employing the factors of production in such quantities and proportions as to obtain the same marginal value product per dollar of factor outlays; this leads them in the long run to build plants of optimal scale, producing levels of output at which average costs are minimized and marginal supply prices are equal to the given demand price for the final product. When we sum the demand prices of the consumers in a particular product market, the market demand price must in equilibrium equal the market supply price obtained by a similar process of summing the individual supply prices of the participating firms in the market. At the same time, however, the resulting demand prices of all industries in a particular factor market must equal the supply prices of the owners of factor services. The aggregate demand for all factors in any period must equal the incomes received by households from supplying factor services in the same period. This provides the household with the given incomes with which we started the analysis of consumer behavior, thus completing the circle. But what reason do we have for thinking that the whole process hangs together? Business firms enter product markets as suppliers but they enter factor markets as buyers; households, on the other hand, are buyers in product markets but suppliers in factor markets. Is equilibrium in product markets necessarily consistent with equilibrium in factor markets? Does the market mechanism guarantee convergence on a general equilibrium solution? If so, is this solution unique or are there several configurations of prices that will satisfy a solution? Even if a unique multimarket equilibrium exists, will it be stable in the sense that a departure from equilibrium sets up automatic forces that bring the system back to equilibrium?” (Blaug, 570).

# General Equilibrium: Basic Idea

- (Price) changes in a single market often spill over into other markets

- Suppose the demand for corn increases, this not only increases the price of corn, but also ultimately affects:
  - the price of **substitutes** for corn (wheat, soy, flax)
  - the price of **complements** with corn (butter, hamburgers)
  - the price of **downstream goods** that corn is an input to [and their complements &amp; substitutes] (corn syrup, sugar, ethanol, gasoline)
  - the price of **upstream goods** for which corn is an output [and their complements &amp; substitutes] (seeds, fertilizer, plows)
]

--

.smallest[
- Changes in each of those markets (even resulting from the corn change) often have feedback back into the corn market!

- We hold *all of this constant* when we examine the .hi-purple[partial equilibrium] of just the corn market

- There are `\(2n+2m-1\)` independent equations to solve, which is exactly equal to the `\(2n+2m-1\)` unknowns in the system
  - 1 good is treated as .hi-purple[numéraire]: its price is set to 1, so all denoted prices are relative to this good 
  - `\(n\)`: number of factors of production
  - `\(m\)`: number of consumer goods
  - Each factor of production, and each final good has a supply and demand function (hence the `\(2n\)` and `\(2m)\)`

- Walras thought merely an .hi-turquoise[existence proof] for general equilibrium consisted in counting the number of equations and unknowns to ensure that the solution is uniquely determined (# of equations `\(=\)` # of unknowns)

- But this is not sufficient:
  - there may still be multiple equilibria
  - we often need additional constraints for economically meaningful answers (non-negative and finite prices &amp; quantities!)
  
- Walras is a bit clumsy and cannot solve his system, but he points out a number of problems that future generations could solve

- A few major questions arise about general equilibrium:

1. Does a general equilibrium *exist*

2. Is the general equilibrium *unique* (determinate), or are there multiple equilibria?

3. Is the general equilibrium *stable*?

- Trade only takes place when an equilibrium set of prices is found

&gt; “There is no general history of economic thought in English which devotes more than passing reference to his work. … This sort of empty fame in English-speaking countries is of course attributable in large part to Walras's use of his mother tongue, French, and his depressing array of mathematical formulas.” — George Stigler, 1941, *Production and Distribution Theories*

&gt; “Walras is...greatest of all economists. His system of economic equilibrium, uniting, as it does, the quality of ‘revolutionary’ creativeness with the quality of classic synthesis, is the only work by an economist that will stand comparison with the achievements of theoretical physics” — Joseph Schumpeter, 1954, *History of Economic Analysis*

# General Equilibrium vs. Partial Equilibrium

.pull-left[

- Lausanne School (Walras, Pareto) always denigrating the Cambridge/British School (Marshall, Jevons, etc.) for not using general equilibrium theory and only focusing on partial equilibrium

- This bitterness unproductively isolated both groups from each other, to everyone’s detriment

- We saw that Marshall understood the idea of general equilibrium, be he was emanently practical, wanted to be helpful in explaining and suggesting policy in the real world, hence: partial equilibrium

- Excessive and redundant to make demand a function of `\(n\)` commodities! Just focus on the 1-2 you are trying to explain
