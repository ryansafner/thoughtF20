> When civilization [population] increases, the available labor again increases. In turn, luxury again increases in correspondence with the increasing profit, and the customs and needs of luxury increase. Crafts are created to obtain luxury products. The value realized from them increases, and, as a result, profits are again multiplied in the town. Production there is thriving even more than before. And so it goes with the second and third increase. All the additional labor serves luxury and wealth, in contrast to the original labor that served the necessity of life.

> “The power of the individual human being is not sufficient for him to obtain (the food) he needs, and does not provide him with as much food as he requires to live. Even if we assume an absolute minimum of food – that is, food enough for one day, (a little) wheat, for instance – that amount of food could be obtained only after much preparation such as grinding, kneading, and baking. Each of these three operations requires utensils and tools that can be provided only with the help of several crafts, such as the crafts of the blacksmith, the carpenter, and the potter. Assuming that a man could eat unprepared grain, an even greater number of operations would be necessary in order to obtain the grain: sowing and reaping, and threshing to separate it from the husks of the ear. Each of these operations requires a number of tools and many more crafts than those just mentioned,” (Introduction, Ch.1 First Prefatory Discussion)

- His broad philosophy and approach, .hi[“Thomism”]:

- We should accept truth no matter where it is found
  - Church teaches that revelation from God (scripture) alone is true
  - But .hi-purple[reason] is a valid source of truth

- Project to reconcile reason (Aristotelianism) with dogma

> "In reason, there is God."

- Writes on economic issues of main interest to us:

- Focuses not on analysis of what *determines* prices

- Focuses instead on .hi-purple[ethical issues of pricing], e.g.:
  - raise the price?
  - lie or cheat in business?
  - pursuit of profits?
  - usury (interest on loans)?

- Main focus: .hi[“just prices and wages”]

> "We might say that for man to be naked is of the natural law, because nature did not give him clothes, but art invented them. In this sense, the possession of all things ... [is] said to be of the natural law, because, namely, the distinction of possession ... [was] not brought in by nature, but devised by human reason for the benefit of human life."

> "[B]uying and selling seem to be established for the common advantage of both parties, one of whom requires that which belongs to the other, and vice versa, as the Philosopher states...[and] should not be more of a burden to one party than to another, and consequently all contracts between them should observe equality of thing and thing...Therefore if either the price exceed the quantity of the thing’s worth, or, conversely, the thing exceed the price, there is no longer the equality of justice: and consequently, to sell a thing for more than its worth, or to buy it for less than its worth, is in itself unjust and unlawful," (p. 19 in *Reader*).

What exactly is the “just price”?

- Price that reflects labor cost?

- Prevailing price in a (competitive) market?

> "According to the Philosopher, exchange of things is twofold; one, natural as it were, and necessary, whereby one commodity is exchanged for another, or money taken in exchange for a commodity, in order to satisfy the needs of life...[The first] belongs rather to housekeepers or civil servants who have to provide the household or the state with the necessaries of life. The other kind of exchange is either that of money for money, or of any commodity for money, not on account of the necessities of life, but for profit...The former kind of exchange is commendable because it supplies a natural need: but the latter is justly deserving of blame, because, considered in itself, it satisfies the greed for gain, which knows no limit and tends to infinity..."

> "Nevertheless, gain which is the end of trading, though not implying, by its nature, anything virtuous or necessary, does not, in itself, connote anything sinful or contrary to virtue: wherefore nothing prevents gain from being directed to some necessary or even virtuous end, and thus trading becomes lawful. Thus, for instance, a man may intend the moderate gain which he seeks to acquire by trading for the upkeep of his household, or for the assistance of the needy: or again, a man may take to trade for some public advantage..."

> "I answer that, to take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leads to inquality which is contrary to justice...If a man wanted to sell wine separately from the use of the wine, he would be selling the same thing twice, or he would be selling what does not exist, wherefore he would evidently coomit a sin of injustice...[by] ask[ing] for double payment, namely one, the return of the thing in equal measure, the other, the price of the use, which is called usury."
