&gt; “The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and tens of thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.”

# Malthusian Economies VI

&gt; "This  paper  examines   the   central   hypothesis   of   the   influential   Malthusian  theory,  according  to  which  improvements  in  the  technological  environment  during  the  preindustrial  era  had  generated  only temporary gains in income per capita, eventually leading to a larger, but not significantly richer, population. Exploiting exogenous sources of cross-country variations in land productivity and the level of  technological  advancement,  the  analysis  demonstrates  that,  in  accordance  with  the  theory,  technological  superiority  and  higher  land productivity had significant positive effects on population density but insignificant effects on the standard of living, during the time period 1–1500 CE."

- This is not the last we will hear of Malthus or his influence on later writers
  - Marx, Keynes

- He will write his own *Principles of Political Economy* (1820) to rival Ricardo
  - Harder to read, less important than his *Essay*

- Great debate with Ricardo in 1810s
  - the first great debate in economics!

- We next turn to the giant that is Ricardo
