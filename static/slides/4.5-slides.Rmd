- Hayek came to LSE during this time, hired by Lionel Robbins

- Became the major competing theory of the business cycle and macroeconomics to Keynes in 1930s

- Focus on capital theory, building off of Mises’ theory of money and credit & Wicksell’s theory of the natural rate of interest

- Revival of Austrian Business Cycle Theory (and Keynesian theory) as possible explanation of 2008-2009 financial crisis

- 1931 *Prices and Production*

- 1941 *The Pure Theory of Capital*

> “Mr. Keynes’ aggregates conceal the most fundamental mechanisms of change.”
		
> “Mr. Keynes’ assertion that there is no automatic mechanism in the economic system to keep the rate of saving and the rate of investing equal might with equal justification be extended to the more general contention that there is no automatic mechanism in the economic system to adapt production to any shift in demand. I begin to wonder whether Mr. Keynes has ever reflected upon the function of the rate of interest...”

- Focuses on the role of interest rates as prices that coordinate capital investment over time
  - Higher interest rates discourage longer term, riskier projects
  - Lower interest rates encourage longer term, riskier projects
  
- Recall, interest rates are determined by the supply (time preference of savers) and demand of loanable funds

- Hayek’s work is a little abstract and difficult to follow, better interpretted by some modern Austrians
